The following appeared in a memorandum to the planning department of an investment firm.
"Costs have begun dropping for serveral types of equipment currently used to convert solar energy into electricity. Moreover, some exciting new technologies for converting solar energy are now being researched and developed. Hence we can expect that solar energy will soon become more cost efficient and attractive than coal or oil as a source of electrical power. We should therefore, encourage investment is Solario, a new manufacturer of solarpowered products. After all, Solario's chief executive was once on the financial planning team for Ready-to-Ware a software engineering firm that has shown remarkable growth since its recent incorporation."

¡¡¡¡Coral reefs are one of the most fragile, biologically complex, and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth. This ecosystem is one of the fascinating paradoxes of the biosphere:
Line how do clear, and thus nutrient-poor, waters support
(5) port such prolific and productive communities? Part of the answer lies within the tissues of the corals themselves. Symbiotic cells of algae known as zooxanthellae carry out photosynthesis using the metabolic wastes of the corals. thereby producing food for themselves, for their coral.
(10) hosts, and even for other members of the reef community This symbiotic process allows organisms in the reef community to use sparse nutrient resources efficiently.
¡¡¡¡Unfortunately for coral reefs, however, a variety of human activities are causing worldwide degradation of
(15) shallow marine habitats by adding nutrients to the water Agriculture, slash-and-burn land clearing sewage disposal and manufacturing that creates waste by-products all increase nutrient loads in these waters. Typeal symptoms of reef decline are destabilized herbivore populations and

4. According to the passage, which of the following is a factor that is threatening the survival of coral reef communities?
  (A) The waters they inhabit contain few nutrient resources.
  (B) A decline in nutrient input is disrupting their symbiotic relationship with zooxamthellae.
  (C) The degraded waters of their marine habitats have reduced their ability to carry out photosynthesis.

¡¡¡¡Two divergent definitions have dominated sociologists discussions of the nature of ethnicity. The first emphasizes the primordial and unchanging character of ethnicity. In this view people have an essential need for belonging that is satisfied by membership in groups based on shared ancestry and culture. A different conception of ethnicity de-emphasizes the cultural component and defines ethnic groups as interest groups. In this view, ethnicity serves as a way of mobilizing a certain population behind issues relating to its economic position. While both of these definitions are useful neither fully captures the dynamic and changing aspects of ethnicity in the United States, Rather, ethnicity is more satisfactorily conceived of as a process in which preexisting communal bonds and common cultural attributes are adapted for instrumental purposes according to changing real-life situations.
¡¡¡¡One example of this process is the rise of participation by Native American people in the broader United States political system since the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's, Besides leading Native Americans to participate more actively in politics (the number of Native American legislative officeholders more than doubled) this movement also evoked increased interest in tribal history and traditional culture, Cultural and instrumental components of ethnicity are not mutually exclusive but rather reinforce one another.
¡¡¡¡The Civil Rights movement also brought changes in the uses to which etnicity was put by Mexican American people. In the 1960's, Mexican Americans formed community-based political groups that emphasized ancestral heritage as a way of mobilizing constituents. Such emerging issues as immigration and voting rights gave Mexican American advocacy groups the means by which of promote ethnic solidarily. Like European ethnic groups in the nineteenth-century United States, late-twentieth-century. Mexican American leaders combined ethnic with contermporary civie symbols. In 1968 Henry Cisneros. then mayor of San Antonio. Texas, cited Mexican leader Benito Juarez as a model for Mexican Americans in their fight for contemporary civil rights. And every year. Mexican Americans celebrate Cinco de Mayo as fervently as many Irish American people embrace St. Patrick's Day (both are major holidays in the countries of origin). with both holidays having been reinvented in the contex of the United States and linked to ideals, symbols and heroes of the United Staes.
6. Which of the following best states the main idea of the passage?
  (A) In their definitions of the nature of ethnicity, sociologists have underestimated the power of the primordial human need to belong.
  (B) Ethnicity is best defined as a dynamic process that combines cultural components with shared political and economic interests.
  (C) In the United States in the twentieth century, ethnic groups have begun to organize in order to further their political and economic interests.
  (D) Ethnicity in the United States has been significantly changed by the Civil Rights movement.

  (A) One is supported primarily by sociologists, and the other is favored by members of ethnic groups
  (B) One emphasizes the political aspects of ethnicity, and the other focuses on the economic aspects.
  (C) One is the result of analysis of United States populations, and the other is the result of analysis of European populations.
  (D) One focuses more on the ancestral components of ethnicity than does the other.
  (E) One focuses more on immigrant groups than does the other.
8. The author of the passage refers to Native American people in the second paragraph in order to provide an example of
  (A) the ability of membership in groups based on shared ancestry and culture to satisfy an essenial human need

¡¡¡¡The fact that superior service can generate a competitive advantage for a company does not mean that every attempt at improving service will create such an advantage. Investments in service like those in production and distribution, must be balanced against other types of investments on the basis of direct, tangible benefits such as cost reduction and increased revenues. If a company is already effectively on a par with its competitors because it provides service that avoids a damaging reputation and keeps customers from leaving at an unacceptable rate, then investment in higher service levels may be wasted since service is a deciding factor for customers only in extreme situations.
¡¡¡¡This truth was not apparent to managers of one regional bank. which failed to improve its competitive position despite its investment in reducing the time a customer had to wait for a teller. The bank managers did not recognize the level of customer inerua in the consumer banking industry that arises from the inconvenience of switching banks. Nor did they analyze their service improvement to determine whether it would attract new customers by producing a new standard of service that would excite customers or by proving difficult for competitors to copy. The only ment of the improvement was that it could easily be described to customers.

  (A) contrast possible outcomes of a type of busness investment
  (B) suggest more careful evaluation of a type of business investment
  (C) illustrate various ways in which a type of business investment could fail to enhance revenues
  (D) trace the general problems of a company to a certain type of business investment
  (E) criticize the way in which managers tend to analyze the costs and benefits of business investments.
14. According to the passage, investments in service are comparable to investments in production and distribution in terms of the
  (A) tangibility of the benefits that they tend to confer
  (B) increased revenues that they ultimately produce
  (C) basis on which they need to be weighted
  (D) insufficient analysis that managers devote to them.
  (E) degree of competitive advantage that they are likely to provide.
15. The passage suggests which of the following about service provided by the regional bank prior to its investment in enhancing that service?
  (A) It enabled the bank to retain customers at an acceptable rate.
  (B) It threatened to weaken the bank's competitive position with respect to other regional banks.
  (C) It had already been improved after having caused damage to the bank's reputation in the past.
  (D) It was slightly superior to that of the bank's regional competitors.
  (E) It needed to be improved to attain parity with the service provided by competing banks.
16. The passage suggests that bank managers failed to consider whether or not the service improvement mentioned in line 19
  (A) was too complicated to be easily described to prospective customers
  (B) made a measurable change in the experiences of customers in the bank's offices
  (C) could be sustained if the number of customers increased significantly
  (D) was an innovation that competing banks could have imitated
  (E) was adequate to bring the bank's general level of service to a level that was comparable with that of its competitors.
17. The discussion of the regional bank (lines 13-24) serves which of the following functions within the passage as a whole?
  (A) It describes an exceptional case in which investment in service actually failed to produce a competitive advantage.
  (B) It illustrates the pitfalls of choosing to invest in service at a time when investment is needed more urgently in another area.
  (C) It demonstrates the kind of analysis that managers apply when they choose one kinw of service investment over another.
  (D) It supports the argument that investments in certain aspects of service are more advantageous than investments in other aspects of service.
  (E) It provides an example of the point about investment in service made in service made in the fist paragraph.
18. The author uses the word "only" in line 23 most likely in order to
  (A) highlight the oddity of the service improvement
  (B) emphasize the relatively low value of the investment in service improvement
  (C) distinguish the primary attribute of the service improvement from secondary attributes.
  (D) single out a certain merit of the service improvement from other merits.
  (E) point out the limited duratin of the actual service improvement.
