The government, therefore, is not guilty of any fiscal wastefulness.

  (B) The government prefers leasing facilities to owning them in cases where the two alter-natives are equally cost-effective.
  (C) If facilities available for leasing come very close to meeting the government's requirements for facilities the government's requirements for facilities the government needs, the government can relax its own requirements slightly and consider those facilities in compliance.
