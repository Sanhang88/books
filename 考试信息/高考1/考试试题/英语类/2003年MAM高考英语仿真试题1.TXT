第三部分： 阅读理解（共20小题；每小题2分，满分40 分）
阅读下面的短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
CATV is a short way of saying "Community antenna（共用天线）television." But "cable television" is the term most people use. Cable television allows viewers to receive TV programs that can't pick up with their regular antennas.
Television signals don't allow the curve（曲线）of the earth. They travel in straight lines in all directions. Signals from a TV station move towards the horizon（地平线；视界）and then go into space. If you live only a few miles from a TV station, you may get a good picture on your set . But if you live more than 50 miles from a station, you may not get any pictures at all.
CATV began in 1948. People in places far from TV stations shared the cost of putting up high antennas. A community antenna was usually placed on a hill, a mountain, or on a high tower. The antenna picked up TV signals and fed them into a small local station. From the station, thick wires called cable ran out to nearby homes. Each person using the cable paid a monthly charge.
CATV worked well, and soon new uses were found for it. Local station could feed programs into empty channels that were not in use. People along the cable could have local news, weather report, and farm and school news at no extra charge.
Today, cable television has moved into cities. It brings in extra programs that city viewers with regular antennas cannot see. It is also used in many classrooms throughout the country.

A. most people use cable television
B."community antenna" is another name for "regular antenna"
C. a community antenna is used for cable television
D. regular antennas cannot pick up TV programs

A. In a curve  B. In a straight line

58.Cable TV is becoming more and more popular because ________.
A. it is free of charge
B. it can provide more programs
C. it provides all TV users good picture
D. TV sets with regular antennas can also have a good reception through CATV
59.On the whole, this passage is about ________.
A. how to put up high antennas　
B. a way of picking up better TV programs
C. how to use the empty channels on your TV set
D. the way that TV signals on your TV set
60.From the passage we can infer that ________.

B
"As I stood in front of the grave（墓）of President Richard Nixon, I was thinking about the time 25 years ago when this President helped bring the United States and China closer together. Young people of our two countries should help this relationship grow."
This remark was made by a Shanghai student when speaking to his fellow students at the Nixon Library in California, U.S.A. He was one of 80 middle school students, from China attending a month-long 'Youth Summit'. The summit was to mark the 25th anniversary（周年）of President Nixon's journey to China, which was the turning point in China-U. S. relations.
The Youth Summit was aimed at increasing the friendship between young students of the two countries through visits and discussions. Seventy-five American students were selected to visit China. They also visited the Nixon Library on July 21 before leaving for Beijing the next day. The head of the Library said he was pleased to see the American and Chinese students talking and laughing together.
One Chinese student said, "I didn't find it particularly difficult to talk with Americans. We have our differences, but we have a lot in common. Dialogue is good for us."
61.The words "Youth Summit" refer to ________.
A. visits to the Nixon Library
B. the Chinese students visit to the USA
C. a meeting discussing relations between China and US
D. activities to strengthen the ties between the Chinese and American students

Except for the sun, the moon looks the biggest object in the sky. Actually it is one of the smallest, and only looks big because it is so near to us. Its diameter is only 2160 miles (3389 km), or a little more than a quarter of the diameter of the earth.
Once a month, or, more exactly, once every 29.5 days, at the time we call "full moon", its whole disc looks bright. At other times only part of it appears bright, and we always find that this is the part which faces towards the sun, while the part facing away from the sun appears dark. People could make their pictures better if they kept this in mind-only those parts of the moon which are lighted up by the sun are brighter. This shows that the moon gives no light of its own. It only throws back the light of the sun, like a huge mirror hung in the sky.
Yet the dark part of the moon's surface is not completely black; usually it is just light enough for us to be able to see its shape, so that we speak of seeing "the old moon in the new moon's arms". The light by which we see the old moon does not come from the sun, but from the earth. We know well how the surface of the sea or of snow, or even of a wet road, may throw back uncomfortably much of the sun's light on to our faces. In the same way the surface of the whole earth throws back enough of the sun's light on to the face of the moon for us to be back to see the parts of it which would otherwise be dark.
64.Why is the dark part of the moon not completely black?
A. The earth throws back sunlight on to the moon.
B. The sun shines on the moon's surface.
C. The moon throws back the light from the sun.
D. The moon has light of its own.
65.How often do we see the moon as its brightest?
A. Once every week.  B. Once every year.
C. Once every 29.5 days. D. Once every 27 days.
66.What is meant by seeing the old moon in the new moon's arms?
A. We can see the dark parts of the moon, though not clearly.
B. The new moon is at its brightest.
C. The dark parts of the moon are bright enough for us to see.
D. Part of the moon's surface is lighted by the sun.
67.Which of these is true?
A. The moon which appears round at its brightest is called full moon.
B. The moon's diameter is exactly one fourth of that of the earth.
C. The light by which we see the old moon comes from the sun.
D. The part of the moon which is not lighted by the sun is completely dark.
D
When I was about 12, I had an enemy, a girl who liked to point out my shortcomings.
Week by week her list grew:I was very thin, I wasn't a good student, I talked too much, I was too proud, and so on. I tried to hear all this as long as I could. At last, I became very angry. I ran to my father with tears in my eyes.
He listened to me quietly, then he asked. "Are the things she says true or not? Janet, didn't you ever wonder what you're really like ? Well, you now have that girl's opinion. Go and make a list of everything she said and mark the points that are true. Pay no attention to the other things she said."
I did as he told me. To my great surprise, I discovered that about half the things were true. Some of them I couldn't change (like being very thin), but a good number I could-and suddenly I wanted to change. For the first time I go to fairly clear picture of myself.
I brought the list back to Daddy. He refused to take it."That's just for you,"he said."You know better than anyone else the truth about yourself. But you have to learn to listen, not just close your ears in anger and feeling hurt. When something said about you is true, you'll find it will be of help to you. Our world is full of people who think they know your duty. Don't shut your ears. Listen to them all, but hear the truth and do what you know is the right thing to do."
Daddy's advice has returned to me at many important moments. In my life, I've never had a better piece of advice.
68.Which do you think would be the best title for this passage?
A. Not an Enemy, but the Best Friend
B. The Best Advice I've Ever Had
C. My Father
D. My Childhood
69.What does "Week by week her list grew" mean?
A. Week by week she discovered more shortcomings of mine and pointed them out to me.
B. She had made a list of my shortcomings and she kept on adding new ones to it so that it was growing longer and longer.
C. I was having more and more shortcomings as time went on.
D. Week by week, my shortcomings grew more serious.
70.Why did her father listen to her quietly?
A. Because he believed that what her daughter's "enemy" said was mostly true.
B. Because he had been so angry with his daughter's shortcomings that he wanted to show this by keeping silent for a while.
C. Because he knew that his daughter would not listen to him at that moment.
D. Because he wasn't quite sure which girl was telling the truth.
71.What did the father do after he had heard his daughter's complaint?
A. He told her not to pay any attention to what her"enemy" had said.
B. He criticized (批评) her and told her to overcome her shortcomings.
C. He told her to write down all that her"enemy" had said about her and pay attention only to the things that were true.
D. He refused to take the list and have a look at it.

Self-employed private physicians who charge a fee for each patient visit are the foundation of medical practice in the United States. Most physicians have a contract relationship with one or more hospitals in the community. They send their patients to this hospital, which usually charges patients according to the number of days they stay and the facilities (operating room, tests, medicines that they use). Some hospitals belong to a city, a state or, in the case of veteran's hospitals, a federal government agency. Others are operated by churches or other non-profit groups.
Some medical doctors are on salary. Salaried physicians may work as hospital staff members, or residents, who are often still in training. They may teach in medical schools, be hired by corporations to care for their workers or work for the federal government's Public Health Service.
Physicians are among the best paid professionals in the United States. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for medical doctors to earn incomes of more than ＄ 100 000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, might earn several times that amount. Physicians list many reasons why they deserve to be so well rewarded for their work. One reason is the long and expensive preparation required to become a physician in the United States. Most would be physicians first attend college for four years, which can cost nearly ＄20  000 a year at one of the best private institutions. Prospective physicians then attend medical school for four years. Tuition alone can be over ＄ 10 000 a year. By the time they have obtained their medical degrees, many young physicians are deeply in debt. They still face three to five years of training in a hospital, the first year as an apprentice physician. The hours are long and the pay is relatively low.
Setting up a medical practice is expensive, too. Sometimes several physicians will decide to establish a group practice, so they can share the expense of maintaining an office and buying equipment. These physicians also take care of each other's patients in emergencies.
Physicians work long hours and must accept a great deal of responsibility. Many medical procedures,even quite routine ones, involve risk. It is understandable that physicians want to be well rewarded for making decisions which can mean the difference between life and death.
72.The expenses for becoming a doctor are spent on ________.
A. schooling and retraining
B. practice in a hospital
C. facilities he or she uses
D. education he or she receives
73.According to the passage, how long does it take for a would－be physician to become an independent physician in the USA?
A. About seven years.  B. Eight years.
C. Ten years.  D. About twelve years.
74.Sometimes several physicians set up a group medical practice mainly because ________.
A. there are so many patients that it is difficult for one physician to take care all of them
B. they can take turns to work long hours
C. facilities may be too much of a burden for one physician to shoulder
D. no one wants to assume too much responsibility
75.Which of the following statements could fully express the author's view towards physicians' payment in the USA?
A. For their expensive education and their responsibility, they deserve a handsome pay.
B. It is reasonable for physicians to have a large income because their work is very dangerous.
C. Physicians should be better paid because they work long hours under bad conditions.
D. Physicians have great responsibility, so it is understandable that they should be well rewarded.

One possible version:
Now in the country areas, there are many children out of school.I think one of the reasons is that their families are too poor to afford their school. As a result, they have to stay at home to get money to keep their families. Another reason is that many parents think it useless for the girls to study and they would not like them to go to school. A third reason is that some children are not interested in their lessons, and would not like to go to school. In my opinion all the children including the girls should have the chance to receive education. All the people should pay attention to the education the children who will play a very important part in the future of our country.

Just watch how I do it. This is simple. You break the eggs first, of course. We need four eggs today. Put them in the big bowl. Now beat them well. Add a little salt. No, you don't put in any sugar. That wouldn't taste right. Then put some oil in the pan. Wait a bit. Now it is hot. We can cook. Remember to stir it. OK, it's now ready to serve. Next time you can do it yourselves when Mum and I are not at home.
