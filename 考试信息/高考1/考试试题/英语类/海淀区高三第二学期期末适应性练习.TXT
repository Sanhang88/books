第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题；每小题2分，满分4分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。

A
I'm beginning to think whether my grandmother was right when she complains, as she frequently does, that children nowadays aren't as well- behavioured as they used to be. She recounts in detail how she used to be told to respect her elders and betters. She was taught to speak when she was spoken to and when she went out on her own, she was reminded to say please and thank you. Children in her days, she continues, were expected to be seen and not heard, but these days you are lucky if you ever hear parents telling their children to mind her manners.

If you give her the chance she then takes out of her writing desk the old photograph album which she keeps there, and which she never tires of displaying. Of course when you look at pictures of her parents you feel sure that, with a father as strict looking as that, you too would have been " seen and not heard". Beside him sits his wife, with their children around her; Granny and her elder brothers. It always occurs to me that perhaps those long, stiff, black clothes were so burdensome (heavy) to a little girl that she hadn't enough breath left to be talkative, let alone mischievous ( 淘气的). It must have been a dull and lonely life too, for she stayed mainly at home during her childhood, while he brothers were sent to school from an early age.

However, my childhood was much freer than Granny's. I went to school with my brother. I played football with him and his friends. We all spoke a common language, and we got up to the same mischief. I would have died if I had ha to stay indoors, wearing tight, stiff clothes.

56. The writer thinks that her grandmother _________.
A. makes mistakes about the youth
B. complains too much about her childhood
C. received good education at school
D. led an unhappy life when she was a child

57. When Granny was young, children were expected ________.
A. to speak to the elders loudly
B. to hear and not to see
C. to be present quietly
D. to stay still and study

58. This passage is mainly about ________
A. Granny's life story in the past
B. Granny's complaints about the children
C. women's life in different times
D. children in the past and at present

B
Let us say there is something you don't know how to do.

In the past of you were determined to learn, you might have called a friend or relative, taken a night class or walked down to the local library for a research term. But now a host of websites are springing up to provide free practical advice on these subjects and actually anything else you can think of .

In one sense, these "how-to" sites represent (表明) a part of the growing world of online learning. This tradition found one of its earliest forms in the FAQs - or Frequently Asked Questions files - that began on Usenet, the Internet' s global discussion group. These FAQs, many of which still circulate (go round continuously), took a specific subject - and explained it to complete novices.

But "how-to" sites take the FAQs idea in a somewhat different direction by addressing subjects that aren't necessarily related to discussion forums (论坛). These sites take the style of a written tutorial (teaching period) and a tone of friendly advice. Possibly the biggest and best known of these sites is learn2. com (www. learn2. com). It offers nearly 1000 free tutorials and adds new ones frequently for a job interview.

At ehow. com (www. ehow. com) you can learn how to train for your first marathon, how to buy a vacation home, or how to make a movie in eight steps.
59.The purpose of writing the passage is to _______
A. introduce new websites to people
B. teach how to take new courses by Internet
C. tresent new means to learn something you want to know
D. help you to solve any difficulty you meet with

60."How-to" sites are set up to _________
A. explain FAQs to the public
B. help people to learn what they want to
C. tell the difference from discussion forums
D. complete the growing world of online learning

61.The underlined word "novices" in the passage probably means ________
A. experts who know a lot
B. hosts of "how-to sites
C. people without knowledge
D. beginners of "how-to" sites

62.It can be inferred from the passage that ________
A. "how-to" sites are specially designed for the disabled
B. people can teach themselves at home by visiting "how-to sites
C. it is pleasant to listen to the advice on "how-to" sites
D. you can just click your mouse at home to question anything

63.According to the text, if you want to buy a tent for camping you may _________
A. visit www. ehow. com
B. visit www. learn2. com
C. visit the discussion forums

Take care about those who use the truth to deceive. When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can make a false impression. For example, someone might say, "I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery. It was great. I took that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars!"
This guy is a winner, right? Maybe, maybe not. We then discovered that he bought two hundred tickets, and only one was a winner. He is really a big loser! He didn't say anything that was false, but he intentionally left out important information. That's called a half-truth. Half truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.
Untrustworthy candidates (候选人) in political campaigns often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lost one million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents (对手.) runs an ad. saying, "During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs!" That's true. However an honest statement would have been, "During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs."
Advertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements so they try to mislead you with the truth. An ad might boast (吹嘘), "Nine out of ten doctors recommend Yucky Pills to cure nose pimples. It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Corporation."
This kind of trick happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truth can lie as well.

68. Which of the statements is true according to the article?
A.All advertisements are lies.
B.You can't trust anyone who tells the truth.
C.The truth can be used in dishonest ways.
D.Whenever people tell the truth, they are really lying.

69.What does the underlined word "deceive" probably mean?
A.tell  B. explain C. foolD. win

70.The writer suggests in this article that people should ________.
A.  believe in nobody
B.  vote for female candidates
C.  stay away from political campaigns
D.  think carefully about what they read and hear

71.What is the best title for this article?
A. Everyone Lies at Present
B. Lying with the Truth
C. Try to Be Honest to the People
D. Don't Believe People Who Tell the Truth

A new study says one part of the human brain may become smaller as the result of a condition known as jet lag. Jet lag results from flying long distances in an airplane. People with jet lag may feel extremely tired for several days. They may also have problems thinking clearly and remembering.
Recently a researcher at the University of Bristol in Britain reported the findings of his jet lag study, which involved twenty young women who worked for international airlines. They had served passengers on airplanes for five years. These flight attendants flew across many countries and at least seven time zones. In the study, the flight attendants had different amounts of time to recover from jet lag. Half the women spent five days or fewer in their home areas between long flights The other half spent more than fourteen days in their home areas.
The researcher took some saliva from the women's mouths to measure levels of a hormone(荷尔蒙) that increases during stress (紧张). He tested them to see if they could remember where black spots appeared on a computer screen. And he took pictures of their brains to measure the size of the brain's temporal lobes (脑叶).
It was found that the women who had less time between flights had smaller right temporal lobes. This area of the brain deals with recognizing and remembering what is seen. The same group performed worse and had slower reaction times on the visual memory test. And their saliva samples showed higher levels of stress hormones.
The researcher believes the brain needs at least ten days to recover after a long trip. He says airline workers told him their ability to remember got worse after working on planes for about four years. Other studies have shown that increased feelings of stress can cause a loss of cells in the part of the brain that controls memory.
Scientists say more tests are needed to study the effects of jet lag on the brain. They want to find out if too much jet lag could permanently (永久性的) affect memory.

72. According to the text, jet lag _________.
A. can cause difficulties in speaking
B. can make people feel tired for a few weeks
C. can be only found in flight attendants
D. can be caused by flying over several time zones

73. It can be inferred from the text that _________.
A. the conclusion is refused by many scientists
B. scientists fear that this research is not done properly
C. every scientific conclusion needs the support from many tests
D. the women who were examined in the research were not healthy

74. From the result of the research we can see that _________.
A. the women who have longer rest at home show better memory
B. the women who fly in short time have smaller right temporal lobes
C. the women who have longer flights fail the memory test
D. the women who rest more than 14 days produce less hormones

75. What is the subject discussed in the text?
A. The cause of jet lag.
B. A story of a group of flight attendants.
C.The importance of having enough rest after flights.
D. A research about the effects of jet lag on the brain.

With the development of Internet, more and more people tend to send electronic cards instead of paper ones at New Year's time. Compared with the traditional cards, electronic cards are more interesting and lively, for you can get not only pictures but also sound and even animations. Besides, it's faster to send an electronic card. There are many web sites on line where different varieties of cards are available. If none of these cards are of any interest to you, you can design cards of unique style using FLASH or other software. More importantly, with the popularity of electronic cards, less paper is used for making paper cards, which contributes to the environment protection.

第二小题
Last month, I bought a new sweater at a big department store, but it has given me enough troubles. When I was in the store, I was told that the sweater is absolutely unshrinkable, and if I wash it in cold water, the colour won't fade (run) at all. However, the first time I washed it, the colour of the water changed into something like grape juice! What is even worse, I found that I can hardly put it on any more after it dried. It's too small.

M: No. Sort of eating quickly and standing up, it's sort of bad for you. The food itself isn't very good for you, you know there's not enough greens, um, you know vegetables or salad.

Most Americans don' t like to get advice from members of their families. When they need advice, they don't usually ask people they know. Instead, many Americans write letters to news-papers and magazines, they can get advice on many different subjects, such as family problems, the use of language, health, cooking, child care, clothes, and how to buy a house or a car.
Most newspapers print letters from readers with problems. There are answers written by doctors, lawyers or educators. But two of the most famous writers of advice are women without special training for this kind of work. One of them is called "Dear Abby" by readers and the other is called "Dear Ann Landers". Experience is their preparation for giving advice.
