According to a recent survey, Canadian parents realize their role as protectors and providers to nourish (培养) their children both emotionally and physically. That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These  'nurturing(教育） moments'are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life. Bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day. Visiting your child's make-believe world. Discussing his other school day. Exploring the natural world outside your door.
These times are not merely a luxury (奢侈), they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image.
Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together:
Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day.
Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun.
Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby.
Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit. The little things you do to your care are the building blocks for confidence, self-esteem and a healthy outlook. By giving your children these tools, you prepare them for life.
63. Present-day parents are different from those in the past mainly because________.
A. they need more time to spend on their children
B. they pay more attention to their children's health

D.benefits the healthy growth of the children

Rome-Doctors and medical groups around the world last weekend reacted with strong opposition to the news that an Italian specialist is on the brink of cloning the first human baby.
Dr. Severino Antinori, who is the head of a hospital in Rome, has been referred to in an Arab newspaper as claiming that one of his patients is eight weeks pregnant (怀孕) with a cloned baby.
Antionori refused to comment on the reports, but in March 2001 he said he hoped to produce a cloned embryo (卵) for implantation within two years. So far seven different kinds of mammals have already successfully cloned, including sheep, cats and most recently rabbits.
Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admitted that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a worldwide ban on the practice.
Professor Rudolf Jaeniscb of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: "I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby. It is using humans as guinea pigs. It makes people feel sick."
But Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute at Darmouth College in the US, said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth.
So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders, many of them dying soon after their births.
Doctors are opposed to human cloning because they are worried about the welfare of the cloned child if there is one.
"There are no benefits of cloned human beings, just harm, "said Dr Michael Wilks of the UK.

68. What is the doctors' general attitude to cloning of humans according to the passage?
A. They are against it.　
B. They support it.
C. They welcome it.　
D. They pay no attention to it.
69. What does the underlined word ban in the third paragraph mean most probably?
A. order that forbids cloning　
B. suggestion to carrying on cloning
C. anger at cloning　
D. cheer for cloning
70. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?
A. Doctor Severion Antinori is strongly opposed to cloning human beings.
B. Up to now, seven kinds of animals have been cloned, including sheep, cats, humans and rabbits.

The 1970s and early 1980s have spelled (意味着) hard time for most of the world's business firms. The 1973 oil crisis (危机) set off a round of further crisis: material and energy shortages, dying industries, and so on.
Throughout the 1960s, people in industrial nations enjoyed real gains in income and spent their money on a growing number of goods and services: new cars, television sets, foreign travel, higher education, and so on. People in the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and a few other nations were leading a good life. And the citizens of less developed countries, though living on very small incomes, were filled with hopes by what they heard and saw in newspapers, magazines, and radios. Sooner or later, they felt, they would enjoy the fruits of rapid economic development.
The crisis starting in the 1970s robbed everyone of these dreams. Prices shot up; jobs were lost; competition became keener; foreign goods attacked domestic (国内的) markets and hurt domestic firms.
The key to recovery could not rest alone on governments' adopting suitable economic policies. Business firms had to do a better job of finding out the strong needs, developing better products, and distributing them more efficiently so that consumers could afford them. In the past, some companies saw their task as simply selling what they made. When consumer interest flagged, the companies encouraged their salespeople to sell harder. They would cut the prices and offer more services. This approach often works in the short run, at least in selling out their goods, if not in increasing profits (利润). But the sales approach provides no long-run answer to raising the interest of people in buying the company's current products.
72. People experienced hard time________.
A. in the 1970s　
B. from the 1970s to the early 1980s
C. in 1973　
D. in the 1980s
73. According to the passage, which of the following is not true?
During the crisis, ________.
A. domestic markets were attacked by foreign goods
B. competition became keener
C. prices were lower
D. there were more people looking for jobs
74. The author emphasizes several points in the passage, EXCEPT________.
A. the oil crisis 　
B. the world political situation
C. the results of the crisis　
D. the world economical situation
75. The passage is taken from________.
A. a novel  B. a play　
C. a report  D. a poem
