第二部分: 英语知识运用
第一节：单项填空
21.My teacher asked me to copy _____ article_____ second time.
A. the, a B. an, the C. an, a D. the, the
[分析]
冠词考查。妈妈让我再次重复那个电话号码，以便他把它记下来。The telephone number 是指说过的电话号码，是特指的。A second time 不是"第二次"而是"又一次，再一次"的意思。

22. After the new technique was introduced, the factory produced _____ in 2001 as the year before.
A. as twice many machines B. twice many as machines
C. twice as many machines D. as many machines twice
[分析]
倍数表达法 ：倍数 + as adj.(adv) as
  倍数 + 比较级 than
  倍数 + the  + 名词 + of
依据此表达法，A、B、D 都被排除掉。

23. --- How could I thank you enough?
--- Don't mention it. Any other man ______ that.
 A. must do B. could doC. would have done D. should have done
[分析]
考查虚拟语气。"我怎谢你呢？""不用提。如果换成其他人，也会这样做的。"此句是一种假设。又是已经发生过的事情。因此用would have done.

24. --- Why are you looking pleased?
--- Oh, I just had a job ______ for next year.
A. offeredB. offering C. to offerD. being offered
[分析]
考察非谓语动词做补语。Have something done 句中"工作"与"提供"之间是被动关系。

25. --- Have you seen your nephew lately?
--- Yes, in fact I saw him yesterday. I _____ him for three years.
A. haven't seen	B. didn't see	C. hadn't seen	D. don't see
[分析]
动词时态考查。"到昨天我看到他时为止，已经三年了。"基点是过去。所以用过去完成时。若到现在为止，当然用现在完成时了。

26. You've just missed your ______, and you will have to wait for the next round.
A. chance	B. turn  C. time	D. part
[分析]
名词区分。"你错过这一轮了，只好等下轮。"Next round 在提示答案。

27. Unfortunately, when I dropped in, Doctor Li _____ for Beijing to join in the fight again SARS, so we only had time for a few words.
A. just left  B. has just leftC. is just leaving D. was just leaving
[分析]
动词时态的考查。从前面看，答案有两种可能性：
１）当我去看他时，他已经到北京抗击非典去了。（用过去完成时）。
２）当我去看他时，他正要去北京抗击非典去。（用过去将来时）。
看结尾：他跟他说了几句话。所以情景是他正要去。又因为come，leave，arrive等动词的进行时表将来时。故答案为D.

28. It is not until you have lost your health ______ you know its value.
A. thatB. when 	C. what 	D. which
[分析]
强调句式：It is (was) + 强调部分＋that(who)+ 其它。此句是对not until 句式进行强调。

29. Have you checked all the goods ______ to the medical next week?
A. sent	B. being sentC. sending	D. to be sent
[分析]
动词不定式做定语。表将来。标志next week。

30. I have been keeping that portrait ______ I can see it every day, as it always reminds me of my childhood in London.
A. whichB. where C. whetherD. when
[分析]
where 引导的地点状语从句。"我把那幅肖像一直放在我每天能看到它的地方。由于它能提醒我在伦敦度过的童年时代。"For example:
 1) Leave her where she is.  2) Put the book where you can find it.

31. I can ______ some noise while I'm studying, but I can't stand very loud noise.

[分析]
动词短语区分。put up with 忍受 ；get rid of 摆脱，甩掉，改掉等；have effects on 对…..有影响；keep away from 远离。题干中stand 提示了答案是A。

33. ---Would you like to go to the concert with me, Mary?
--- I have got no interest in it;______, I have lots of homework to do.
A. otherwiseB. besidesC. however D. therefore
[分析]
对副词，介词，连词进行考查。"我不敢兴趣，而且还有很多工作要做。"前后是递进关系。因此答案为B。

34. The accident was my fault, so I had to pay for the damage______ the other car.
A. ofB. at  C. to  D. on
[分析]
 此处damage 是名词。它的用法为damage to something. 意思是"对…….的伤害，损害等"。　For example: 1) Frost caused heavy damage to the crops.
2) His careless remark did damage to his reputation(名誉).

35. --- How come a simple meal like this costs so much?
--- We have _____ in your bill the cost of the teapot you broke just now.
