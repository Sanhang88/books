第三部分： 阅读理解（共20小题；每小题2分，满分40 分）
阅读下面的短文，从每题所给的四个选项(A、B、C和D)中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
Moviegoers may think history is repeating itself this weekend.The summers most anticipated film,Pearl Harbor,which has opened recently,painstakingly recreates the Japanese attack that drew the United States into World War Ⅱ.But that isn't the films only reminder of the past.Harbor invites comparison to Titanic,the biggest hit of all time.Like Titanic,harbor heaps romance and action around a major historical event.Like Titanic,Harbor attempts to create popular global entertainment from a deadly real life.Like Titanic,Harbor costs a pretty penny and hopes to get in even more at the box office.Both Titanic and Pearl Harbor unseal their tales of love and tragedy over more than three hours.Both stories center on young passion,triangles of tension with one woman and two men:In Titanic,Leonardo DiCaprio and Billy Zane compete for the love of the same woman,a high-society type played by a British actress named Kate (Winslet).In Harbor,two pilots (Ben Affelck,Josh Hartnett) fall for the same woman,a nurse played by a British actress named Kate (Beckinsale).The scenes of peril also have similarities.Harbor has a shot in which soldiers cling for dear life as the battleship USS Oklahoma capsizes.The moment is recalled of the Titanic's climactic sinking scene in which DiCaprio and Winslet hang from the ocean liner as half of the ship vertically plunges into the water.In Harbor,one of its stars floats atop a piece of debris in the middle of the night,much like Winslet's character does in Titanic.And the jaw-dropping action of Titanic is matched by Harbor's 40 minute recreation of Dec.7,1941 attack on the United States Pacific Fleet.Both films spent heavily on special effects.Harbor director,Michael Bay,for example,says he kept salaries down so more could be spent on the visuals.Both movies event shot their ship-sinking scenes at the same location: Fox Studios Baja in Mexico.Harbor's makers have even taken a Titanic-like approach to the soundtrack.The film includes one song.There you'll be,performed by country music superstar Faith Hill.Titanic,which is one of the best selling soundtracks of all time,also had only one pop song: Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On."If Harbor becomes a major moneymaker,filmmakers may comb history books searching for even more historical romance-action material," says a critic.
56.What are the two things that the author of this article tries to compare？
A.The attack on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Titanic.
B.Historical fiction movies and successful box office hits.
C.The movie Titanic and the on-show movie Pearl Harbor.
D.Sinking boats and famous actors.
57.Pearl Harbor and Titanic are similar in all the following aspects EXCEPT________.
A.both spent large amount of money on special effects
B.both have soundtracks starring a major pop star
C.both added made-up stories to historical events
D.both are documentary movies（纪录片）of historical events
58.If Pearl Harbor is as successful as Titanic,which of the following movies might we see next？
A.The Battle of Waterloo. 　　　
B.The Adventures of Mr.Bean.
C.Space Invaders.
D.The Haunted House.
B
One of the qualities that most people admire in others in the willingness to admit one's mistakes.It is extremely hard sometimes to say a simple thing like "I was wrong about that," and it is even harder to say ,"I was wrong,and you were right about that."
I had an experience recently with someone admitting to me that he had made a mistake fifteen years ago.He told me he had been the manager of a certain store in the neighborhood where I grew up,and he asked me if I remembered the egg cartons（in many countries,eggs are sold by the dozen and are put in cartons.）Then he related an incident（event,matter）and I began to remember unclearly the incident he was describing.
I was about eight years old at the time.I went into the store with my mother to do some shopping.On that particular day,I must have found my way to the food department where the incident took place.
There must have been a special sale on eggs that day because there were lots of eggs in dozen and half-dozen cartons.The cartons were put three or four feet high.I must have stopped in front of the piles of egg cartons.Just then a woman came by pushing her shopping cart and knocked off the cartons.For some reason,I decided it was up to me to put the eggs back together,so I went to work.
The manager heard the noise and came rushing over to see what had happened.When he appeared,I was on my knees looking at some of the cartons to see if any of the eggs were broken,but to him it looked as though I was the one who just did it.He severely reprimanded me and wanted me to pay for any broken eggs.I tried to explain,but it did no good.Even though I quickly forgot all about the incident,it is plain that the manager did not.
59.According to this passage,many people will have a good opinion of those who________.
A.have never made any mistakes
B.often make mistakes but correct them in no time
C.admit their mistakes
D.forget other people's mistakes easily
60.Which is the correct order of the following？
a.I forgot all about the incident.
b.I went into the store.
c.A woman knocked off the egg cartons.
d.I stood in front of the egg cartons.
e.The manager reminded me of the incident.
f.The manager didn't believe my explanation.
g.I picked up the unbroken eggs.
A.b; d; g; c; a; f; e B.b; d; c; g; f; e; a
C.b; c; d; g; e; f; a D.b; d; c; g; f; a; e
61.The word "reprimanded" in the last paragraph most exactly means"________".
A.frightened　　 B.scolded　　　 C.warned　　　 D.comforted
62.The best title for this passage should be________.
A.A Case of Mistake  B.The Manager I Never Forget
C.The Manager and I  D.An Incident 15 Years Ago

A higher reading rate,with no loss of comprehension,will help you in other subjects as well as in English,and the general principles apply to any language.Naturally,you will not read every book at the same speed.You would expect to read a newspaper,for example,much more rapidly than a physics or economics textbook-but you can raise your average reading speed over the whole range of materials you wish to cover so that the percentage gained will be the same whatever kind of reading you are concerned with.
The reading passages which follow are all of an average level of difficulty for your stage of instruction.They are all about five hundred words long.They are about topics of general interest which do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge.Thus they fall between the kind of reading you might find in your textbooks and the much less demanding kind you will find in a newspaper or light novel.If you read this kind of English,with understanding at four hundred words per minute,you might skim (浏览) through a newspaper at perhaps 650~700 ,while with a difficult textbook you might drop to two hundred or two hundred and fifty.
Perhaps you would like to know what reading speeds are common among native English-speaking university students and how those speeds can be improved.Tests in Minnesota,U.S.A,for example,have shown that students without special training can read English of average difficulty,for example,Tolstoy's War and Peace in translation,at speeds of between 240 and 250 words per minute with about seventy percent comprehension.Students in Minnesota claim that after twelve half-hour lessons,once a week,the reading speed can be increased,with no loss of comprehension,to around five hundred words per minute.
63.According to the passage,the purpose of effective reading with higher speed is most likely to help you________.
A.only in your reading of a physics textbook
B.improve your understanding of an economics textbook
C.not only in your language study but also in other subjects
D.choose the suitable materials to read
64.Which of the following does not describe the types of reading materials mentioned in the  second paragraph?
A.Those beyond one's reading comprehension.
B.Those concerned with common knowledge.
C.Those without much demand for specialized knowledge.
D.Those with the length of about five hundred words.
65.The average speed of untrained native speakers in the University of Minnesota is________.
A.about 300 words per minute
B.about 245 words per minute
C.about 650~770 words per minute
D.about 500 words per minute
66.According to the passage,how fast can you expect to read after you have attended twelve half-hour lessons in the University of Minnesota?
A.You can increase your reading speed by three times.
B.No real increase in reading speed can be achieved.
C.Yon can increase your reading speed by four times.
D.You can double your reading speed.

When you are travelling,whether on business or for pleasure,you often need to stay in a hotel.The kind of hotel you choose probably is decided above all according to how much money you want to spend.There are small hotels with very few services,where the prices are low,or there are large hotels with all the very latest comforts,where you could spend all the money you have in the bank for one very comfortable night.
There are several different kinds of people who go to hotels.Some want to live,rather than just stay,in a hotel; the hotels which are designed to meet their needs are called residential hotels.However,most people who stay in hotels are either business people or tourists on holiday.
In most hotels,there are two kinds of rooms: single rooms,for the use of one person,and double rooms,for the use of two people.In addition,in large hotels,there are also suites(套房),which include two or more rooms connected together-perhaps a bed-room and a living room.There are for people who are very rich or very important.
72.One's choice of a particular hotel is made mainly according to ________.
A.how much one is willing to pay for a night

One possible version:
The next day after the incident, a woman came to admit that it was she,not the boy,who broke the eggs.I was shocked.I admired the woman's courage to admit her mistake.
 In my heart I blamed myself.I waited and waited for a chance to say sorry to the boy.But he didn't appear until one morning fifteen years later.
That morning I recognized him the moment he entered the store though he had grown up into a young man.He was quite surprised when I told him about the broken eggs.He seemed to have forgotten all about it.
 I made an apology from my heart.He accepted it honestly.At last I breathed freely again!
