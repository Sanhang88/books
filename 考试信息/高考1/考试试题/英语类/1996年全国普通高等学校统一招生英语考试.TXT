The measure of a man's real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out. -Thomas Macaulay
Some thirty years ago, I was studying in a public school in New York. One day, Mrs Nanette O'Neill gave an arithmetic 26 to our class. When the papers were 27 she discovered that twelve boys had made exactly the 28 mistakes throughout the test.
There is nothing really new about 29 in exams. Perhaps that was why Mrs O'Neill 30 even say a word about it. She only asked the twelve boys to 31 after class. I was one of the twelve.
Mrs O'Neill asked 32 questions, and she didn't 33 us either. Instead, she wrote on the blackboard the 34 words by Thomas Macaulay. She then ordered us to 35 these words into our exercise-books one hundred times.
I don't 36 about the other eleven boys. Speaking for 37 I can say:it was the most important single 38 of my life. Thirty years after being 39 to Macaulay's words, they 40 seem to me the best yardstick(准绳), because they give us a 41 to measure ourselves rather than others.
42 of us are asked to make 43 decisions about nations going to war of armies going to battle. But all of us are called 44 daily to make a great many personal decisions. 45 the wallet, found in the street, be put into a pocket 46 turned over to the policeman? Should the 47 change received at the store be forgotten or 48? Nobody will know except 49. But you have to live with yourself, and it is always 50 to live with someone you respect.

32. A. no 　B. certain C. many  D. more
33. A. excuseB. reject  C. help  D. scold

We walked in so quietly that the nurse at the desk didn't even lift her eyes from the book. Mum pointed at a big chair by the door and I knew she wanted me to sit down.

Mum just pushed harder, each swipe(拖一下)of the mop taking her farther and farther down the hall. I watched until she was out of sight and the nurse had turned back to writing in the big book.

When you want to see if a library has the book you want, you can use the catalogue(目录)in the library. Most catalogues of books in a library take the form of small cards kept in boxes. One way of arranging(排列)the cards is in ABC order by the family names of the writers.
Catalogue cards usually give the following important information:(1)the name of the writer, (2)the shelf-mark(架号), that is, the Dewey number which helps people to find where the books are, (3)the title of the book, (4)the year of publication and the publisher, and (5) the number of pages in the book.

Most animals have little connection with animals of a different kind, unless they hunt them for food. Sometimes, however, two kinds of animals come together in a partnership(伙伴关系)which does good to both of them. You may have noticed some birds sitting on the backs of sheep. This is not because they want a ride, but because they find easy food in the parasites (寄生虫)on sheep. The sheep allow the birds to do so because they remove the cause of discomfort. So although they can manage without each other, they do better together.
Sometimes an animal has a plant partner. The relationship develops until the two partners cannot manage without each other. This is so in the corals(珊瑚)of the sea. In their skins they have tiny plants which act as"dustman", taking some of the waste products from the corals and giving in return oxygen which the animal needs to breathe.
