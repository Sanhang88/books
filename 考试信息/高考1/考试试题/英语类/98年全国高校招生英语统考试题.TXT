  At 9:00 Dick Spivak's bank telephoned and said his payment was
late."The check is in the post,"Dick replied quickly.At 11:45 Dick
left for a 12:00 meeting across town.Arriving late,he explained
that traffic（交通）had been had.That evening,Dick's girlfriend
wore a new dress.He hated it."It looks just great on you,"he said.
  Three lies in one day!Yet Dick Spivak is just an ordinary man.
Each time,he told himself that sometimes the truth causes too
many problems.Most of us tell much the same white lies,harmless
untruths that help to save trouble.Hos often do we tell white
lies?It depends in part on our age,education,and even where we
live.According to one U.S.study,women are more truthful than men,
and honesty increases as we get older.
  While most people use little white lies to make life easier,the
majority of Americans care about honesty in both public and
personal life.They say that people today are less honest than
they were ten years ago.Although it is believed that things are
getting worse,lying seems to be an age-old human problem.The
