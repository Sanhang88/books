The Channel Islands are a group of British-owned islands lying in the English Channel(海峡), 10 to 30 miles off the French coast, and 70 to 90 miles from the English coast. There are ten islands with a total land area of 75 square miles and a total population of 123,000. The three largest islands, Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, have long been known for the fine breeds(品种)of cattle that are raised on them and named after them.
In earliest known history the islands were considered part of Normandy, which was part of France, but the ruler of Normandy became king of England in 1066, and from then on the islands were looked upon as British land. English control was unbroken until World War II, when the Germans held the islands for five years.
Although people on the islands speak both languages and they are considered English, their customs are more French than English.

James Cleveland Owens was the son of a farmer and the grandson of black slaves. His family moved to Cleveland when he was 9. There, a school teacher asked the youth his name.
"J.C.",he replied.
She thought he had said"Jesse", and he had a new name.
Owens ran his first race at age 13. After high school, he went to Ohio State University. He had to work part time so as to pay for his education. As a second-year student, in the Big Ten games in 1935, he set even more records than he would in the Olympic Games a year later.
A week before the Big Ten meet, Owens accidentally fell down a flight of stairs. His back hurt so much that he could not exercise all week, and he had to be helped in and out of the car that drove him to the meet. He refused to listen to the suggestions that he give up and said he would try, event by event. He did try, and the results are in the record book.
The stage was set for Owens' victory at the Olympic Games in Berlin the next year, and his success would come to be regarded as not only athletic(体育的)but also political. Hitler did not congratulate any of the African-American winners.
"It was all right with me,"he said years later."I didn't go to Berlin to shake hands with him, anyway."
Having returned from Berlin. He received no telephone call from the president of his own country, either. In fact, he was not honored by the United States until 1976, four years before his death.
Owens' Olympic victories made little difference to him. He earned his living by looking after a school playground, and accepted money to race against cars, trucks, motorcycles, and dogs.
"Sure, it bothered(烦扰)me,"he said later."But at least it was an honest living. I had to eat."
In time, however, his gold medals(奖牌)changed his life."They have kept me alive over the years,"he once said."Time has stood still for me. That golden moment dies hard."
55. Owens got his other name"Jesse"when __________.
A. he went to Ohio State University
B. his teacher made fun of him
C. his teacher took"J.C."for"Jesse"
D. he won gold medals in the Big Ten meet
56. In the Big Ten meet, Owens __________.
A. hurt himself in the back
B. succeeded in setting many records
C. tried every sports event but failed
D. had to give up some events
57. We can infer from the text that Owens was treated unfairly in the US at that time because __________.
A. he was not of the right race
B. he was the son of a poor farmer
C. he didn't shake hands with Hitler
D. he didn't talk to the US president on the phone
58. When Owens says"They have kept me alive over the years,"he means that the medals __________.
A. have been changed for money to help him live on

Fish Ears Tell Fish Tales
Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths.
As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate(碳酸钙).By looking through a microscope(显微镜)and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree.
Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements(元素)of each otolith ring.
The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring.
Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history.
In tne case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles.
This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the whereabouts of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears.
63. What can we learn about fish ears from the text?
A. They are small soft rings.
B. They are not seen from the outside.
C. They are openings only on food fish.
D. They are not used to receive sound.
64. Why does the writer compare the fish to trees?
A. Trees gain a growth ring each day.
B. Trees also have otoliths.
C. Their growth rings are very small.
D. They both have growth rings.
65. Why is it important to study the chemistry of otolith rings?
A. The elements of the otoliths can tell the history of the sea.
B. Chemical contents of otoliths can tell how fast fish can swim.
C. We can know more about fish and their living environment.
D. Scientists can know exactly how old a fish is.
66. How would you understand"fish scientists are now lending their ears"?
A. They are very interested in Thorrold's research findings.
B. They want to know where they can find fish.
C. They lend their fish for chemical studies.
D. They wonder if Thorrold can find growth rings from their ears.

The United States: 　Fliers may want to have their tickets in hand before catching their planes, but the airline companies are doing everything they can to bring forward cost-saving ticketless flight- no paper needed, just a ticket number and a photo ID(带照片的身份证). Anyone who buys a Northwest E-ticket through the airline's computer service by June 16 will get an award(奖励). Next time you fly, you can buy another ticket for a friend for $99, good anywhere in the US or Canada through Feb. 12, 2000, along with the lowest ticket prices. Some airlines offer extra frequent-flier miles for the ticketless crowd. And there are rising punishments for paper lovers. American, Northwest, United, and last week，US Airways have raised the cost for lost-ticket replacement(替换)to $70 from either $60 or $50 . The airlines insist that the increase in price is not meant to push travelers toward E-tickets but only covers the increasing cost of replacing and tracking a missing ticket.
67. Why is the new ticketless flight introduced?
A. It is cheaper for air travelers.
B. It helps reduce the cost for airlines.
C. It can use computer to plan air traveling.
D. It helps prevent fliers from losing their tickets.
68. To encourage people to take ticketless flights, the airlines ___________.
A. sell their tickets for $99 from June to February the following year
B. let travelers go to both the US and Canada with the same tickets
C. allow each traveler to have an extra $99 ticket for a friend of theirs

A. People who like to have paper airplane tickets.
B. People who love paper products of various kinds.
C. People who travel with paper on a plane.
D. People who have lost their ticket and buy a second one.
