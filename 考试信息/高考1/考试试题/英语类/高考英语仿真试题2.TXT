第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题，每小题2分，满分40分）
阅读下面的短文，从每题所给的四个选项(A、B、C、D)中，选出最佳选项。

A
   When you are travelling,whether on business or for pleasure,you often need to stay in a hotel.The kind of hotel you choose probably is decided above all according to how much money you want to spend.There are small hotels with very few services,where the prices are low,or there are large hotels with all the very latest comforts,where you could spend all the money you have in the bank for one very comfortable night.
   There are several different kinds of people who go to hotels.Some want to live,rather than just stay,in a hotel;the hotels which are designed to meet their needs are called residential hotels.However,most people who stay in hotels are either business people or tourists on holiday.
   In most hotels,there are two kinds of rooms:single rooms,for the use of one person,and double rooms,for the use of two people.In addition,in large hotels,there are also suites(套房),which include two or more rooms connected together-perhaps a bed-room and a living room.There are for people who are very rich or very important.
56.One's choice of a particular hotel is made mainly according to ______.
A.how much one is willing to pay for a night

Another Way of Thinking"Failure"
 In one way of thinking,failure is part of life.In another way,failure may be a way towards success.The "spider-story"is often told.Robert Bruce,the leader of the Scots in the 13th century,was hiding in a cave from the English.He watched a spider spinning a web. The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock.He tried six times to span(跨过)the gap.On the seventh time he made it and went on to spin his web.Bruce is said to have taken heart and to have gone to defeat the English.Edison,the inventor of the light bulb( 灯泡),made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often,he replied,"Failure?I have no failure.Now I know 50 000 ways it won't work."
   So what?First,always think about your failure.What caused it?Were conditions right?Were you in top form yourself?What can you change so things will go right next time?
 Second,is the goal you're trying to reach the right one?Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be .Think about this question."If I do succeed in this,where will it get me?"This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway.
The third thing to bear in mind about failure is that it's a part of life.Learn to live with yourself,even though you maybe have failed.
60.T	his passage deals with_____.
A.failure and successs

A.check out your goals to see if they are right for you

About Doing Shopping
 I know a woman who likes to do grocery shopping,but I also know a whole lot of people who hate it.People who hate the shopping are likely to like supermarkets,those huge stores where almost everything you need to feed your family or to clean and support your home is able to be got in one place.
The supermarket saves me both money and time.The little corner grocery store is often more conveniently found,more pleasant and open at late hour when the supermarket is closed.But the grocer must ask you for more money than the big market because he can  only buy a small number of cases of one product,while a supermarket can buy cheaper and can sell cheaper to you.
 However,food is very farm from cheap so I always hunt for bargains(讨价政治还价),I check advertisements in newspapers and the market's "sale" papers,any try to make up a shopping list that includes "sale" items.
65.People like to go shopping in supermarkets because ______.
A.they are quite huge
B.there is everything you need in them
C.they are conveniently found
D.they often closed late
66.The grocer asks you for more money______.

D
 Can trees talk?Yes-but not in words.Scientists have reasons to believe that trees do communicate with each other.Not long ago,researchers learned some surprising thing.First a willow tree(柳树)attacked in the woods by caterpillars（毛毛虫）changed the chemistry of its leaves and made them taste so terrible that the caterpillars got tired of the leaves and stopped eating them.The even more astonishing,the tree sent out a special vapour-a signal causing its neighbours to change the chemistry of their own leaves and make them less tasty.
Communication,of course,doesn't need to be always in words.We can talk to each other by smiling,raising our shoulders and moving our hands.We know that birds and animals use a whole vocabulary of songs,sounds,and movements.Bees dance their signals,flying in certain patterns that tell others bees where to find nectar（花蜜）for honey.So why shouldn't trees have ways of sending mesages?

WTO
The World Trade Organization(WTO),founded on January 1,1995,aims to encourage international trade to flow as freely possible,making sure that trade agreements are  respected and that any disputes(争端)can be settled.
In the five years since its founding,the WTO has become well known as one of the world's most powerful economic(经济)organizations,taking its place alongside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The system of global rules for international trade,however,dates back half a century to 1948 when the General Agreement on Tariffs(关税)and Trade(GATT) was formed after World War Ⅱ.
As time went by,it became clear that the GATT had two major weak points-the limited areas of trade it covered,and the lack of an effective system to settle disputes.
 After seven years of trade talks ending in 1994-the so-called Urugray Round,it finally gave birth to the WTO,complete with an effective system to settle disputes and new rules covering trade in services and intellectual property(知识产权).
 Even after seven years of talks and 22,500 pages of agreements there were still problems,especially the difficult-to-deal-with areas of agriculture and services,which the member nations agreed to revisit in 2000.
 The WTO,with its head office in Geneva,has 135 members with 30 more waiting to join.
72,From the passage we know that the GATT stopped working_____.
A.soon after World War ended
B.just at the end of the year 1994
C.a little more than 50 year after World War Ⅱ
D.seven years before the Uruguay Round talk
87.Compared with the GATT,the WTO_____.
A.can do better to settle disputes in more areas of international trade
B.got its members to sign agreements morle easily
C.has got too many areas of international trade to deal with effectively
D.didn't pay enough attention to services and intellectual property
74.In the new century the WTO will_____.
A.take the place of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
B.have new rules covering trace in services and intellectual property
C.make complete new rules in every area of international trade
D.have more members and do much more to settle more problems
75.Another best title for the paragraph is______.
A.WTO-another name for GATT
B.WTO-an international service organization
C.WTO-one of the world's strongest economic organizations
D.WTO-the world's most powerful economic organization
