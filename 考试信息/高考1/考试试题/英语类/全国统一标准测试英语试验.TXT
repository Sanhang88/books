BAGHADA (Reuters)-Iraq urged Arabs on Monday to seek martyrdom (殉难;牺牲)by attacking U.S.forces in Kuwait, saying the Americans were preparing to occupy Iraq.
"We in Iraq and in the entire (Arab) nation believe that every faithful Arab has the right, duty, and the honor to deal with these forces in Kuwait,"a spokesman was replying to the comments by al-Attiya, Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), in which he turned down an apology by President Saddam Hussein to the Kuwaiti people for the 1990 invasion(入侵).
Saddam apologized Saturday for his 1990- 1991 invasion of the country, but scolded Kuwait rulers for conspiring (同谋;搞阴谋) with Washington against the Baghdad government.
Kuwait turned down the apology and said Saddam's message amounted to "incitement (煽动) for terrorism".
The Iraq spokesman said, "Does Attiya not know that the U.S.forces occupy Kuwait, start from there to destroy the Iraq and kill the Iraqis, and that the U.S.army forces plan to occupy Iraq?"
The GCC is made up of Kuwait, Saudi, Arabian, United Arab Empires, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.
UAE Information Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zaid al-Nahayan said Saddam's speech had cost Baghdad what support it had left in the Arab world.
"I believe the speech cost the Iraq leadership any pity it had left and further proved the weakness of Iraq's political and media credibility (可靠性;确实性) at a time when Iraq needs to try its best to get rid of the threat of a face off,"Sheikh Abdullah told the official Kuwait News Agency.
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug.2, 1990.U.S.-led united forces drove the Iraq army from the oil-rich state in February，1991.
Thousands of U.S.troops have been sent to Kuwait since the 1991 Gulf War.However, these forces have been attacked several times in recent weeks.At least one U.S.soldier has died.

Remember your first romantic disappointment? Remember the pain and unhappiness of breaking-up-uncertainty? Winne recalls feeling very sad after her first true love deserted (抛弃) her.My mom came into my room carrying a beautiful nightgown and handed it to me, gave me a hug and said,"I know you are feeling very heartbroken.I thought you could use something to make you feel beautiful right now." The nightgown didn't make Winne's hurt go away, but she knew that her mother understood and cared about her feelings.
As a parent, as much as you want to make it all better for your teen, give them space.Tell him or her that break-ups are hard and you are there for him whenever he wants to speak to you.Then let go.
Teenage girls often deal with break-ups by talking on the phone with their friends or diving into the Internet for a long chat.They review all the hurts and pains that are being cured.Boys react to broken relationships differently.Boys often become angry since that, unfortunately, is the only emotional (感情) choice that society accepts for boys.Some boys hide their pain.Respect your teen, when a relationship breaks up.It takes time to get over it, and the only way to get through that is to get through it.
  Sometimes teenagers get into trouble while trying to feel accepted again or win back a loved one.Keep reaching out to troubled teenagers.At first, teens will refuse a parent's attempts to help.Don't be afraid to insist.
Teen break-ups can cause heart-wrenching pain, but sooner or later teenagers should be ready to date(约会) again.How can you make your child toward a healthy relationship? Teens are likely to meet others like themselves through activities.The secret to attracting good boys or girls is to become your own independent person who feels good about who she is and what she's about.

Farmers could grow more rice and shaky Internet communications could work better some day, thanks to prize-winning discoveries by teen-age scientists showed at a national science fair on Monday.
High-school scientists from across the United States showed off work in genetics (遗传学), molecular biology, mathematics and other fields that judges said rose to the professional level.
"It just blows me away.They're all just unimaginable,"said Joel Spencer, a New York University professor who served as a judge at the Sidemen's Westinghouse Competition in Math, Science and Technology.
Research done by finalists in the nationwide competition could lead to faster Internet speeds, more effective antibacterial drugs and better energy conservation.One team researched black holes in outer space, while another examined more than 700 fossils to better understand why dinosaurs died out.
Juliet Girard and Roshan Prabhu won $100000 scholarship for their work proving genes (基因) that help some strains of wild rice flower earlier than others.
Drawing on a database(数据库) that described the genetic makeup of rice, the two students, from Jersey City, New Jersey, identified two genetic segments (sections) that directed wild rice to blossom an average of 10 days earlier than the ordinary short-grain rice that feeds much of the world.
Their discovery could allow genetic engineers to develop a new strain that would take less time to reach maturity, allowing farmers to produce more and extending the growing region into colder climates.
Steven Byrnes of Lexington, Massachusetts, took the top individual prize for his theory describing outcomes in a two-player game called Chomp.
Several said they planned to publish their findings in famous professional magazines.
63.What made the university professors surprised was that ___________.
A.high school students did well in many fields
B what the high school students did was beyond the imagination of scientists
C.the work of the high school students was of high quality and reached the professional level
D.high school students have found out why dinosaurs died out
64.Which of the following is true?
A.Two students discovered the way of growing more rice and growing rice in colder climates.
B.What the two students discovered about genetic makeup of rice may lead to an important development in agriculture.
C.Steven Byrnes took the top prize at the national science fair on Monday.
D.Several students planned to write more articles in some professional magazines.
65.What is this report mainly about?
A.Farmers can grow more rice and shaky Internet communications can work better after the competitions are held.
B.Some high school students have become professional scientists.
C.High school students can make great contributions to the world in many fields just like adult scientists.
D.A national science fair made scientists greatly surprised.

We gather a great deal of incidental knowledge from pets.If we look after them properly we learn what they like and dislike.We do not set out to gain this knowledge purposely, but in attending to our pets we gain it by the way.It is got without our realizing it.
In keeping our dogs or cats we learn about various diseases that can affect them, and the cures for these diseases.We learn how much sleep they need and what kind of food keeps them healthy.In looking after our fish we learn about the composition of water.We get to know what kinds of fish can live peacefully together and what kinds are hostile (敌对的) to each other.We learn that animals, fish and birds have a lot of things in common with human beings.
If children keep pets their general education is helped by this kind of incidental knowledge.One little incident after another in which their pets are involved adds to their store of learning.It is a more interesting form of learning than that given in the biology lesson in school.People who keep pets should have a sense of responsibility towards them.Children, too, should be taught to be responsible.Pets are completely dependent on their owners and the owners should respond to this dependence by looking after them.Irresponsible behavior towards pets is a form of cruelty.
In deciding to keep a pet we take on a task, we make ourselves responsible for providing proper food and shelter for the pet.In a crowded city like Hong Kong, where there is so little room for the exercise required by large pets, we should think twice before undertaking the responsibility of keeping one.
66.In keeping pets, we learn that ___________.
A.pets dislike human beings

69.In the last paragraph, the word "twice" can best be replaced by "___________".
A.later  B.two times
C.second  D.carefully
70.In Hong Kong, it is not proper to keep large pets because ___________.

Foxes and farmers have never got on well.These small dog-like animals have long been scolded for killing farm animals.They are officially regarded as harmful and farmers try to keep their numbers down by shooting or poisoning them.
Farmers can also call on the services of their local hunt to control the fox population.Hunters hunt a fox across the countryside, with a group of specially trained dogs, followed by men and women riding horses.When the dogs finally catch the fox they kill it or a hunter shoots it.
People who take part in hunting think of it as a sport; they wear a special uniform of red coats and white trousers, and follow strict rules of behavior.But owninga horse and hunting regularly is expensive, so most hunters are wealthy.
It is estimated that up to 100000 people watch or take part in fox hunting.But over the last couple of decades the number of people who object to fox hunting,because they think it is cruel, has risen sharply.Nowadays it is rare for a hunt to pass off without some kind of confrontation (冲突) between hunters and hunt saboteurs (阻拦者).Sometimes these incidents lead to violence, but mostly saboteurs interfere with the hunt by misleading riders and disturbing the trail of the fox's smell, which the dogs follow.
Noisy confrontations between hunters and saboteurs become so common that they are almost as much a part of hunting as the hunting of foxes itself.But this year supporters of fox hunting face a much bigger threat to their sport.A Labor Party Member of the Parliament, Mike Foster, is trying to get Parliament to pass a new law which will make the hunting of wild animals with dogs illegal(非法的).If the law is passed, wild animals like foxes will be protected under the ban in Britain.
71.Rich people in Britain have been hunting foxes__________.
A.for fun
B.to limit the fox population
C.in the interests of the farmers
D.to show off their wealth
72.What is special about fox hunting in Britain?
A.It includes the use of deadly poison.
B.It is a costly event that rarely occurs.
C.The hunters have set rules to follow.
D.The hunters have to go through strict training.
73.People who object to fox hunting often interfere in the game___________.
A.by using violence
B.by taking legal action
C.by beating the fox hunters
D.by standing in line to stop the hunting
74.A new law may be passed by the British Parliament to ___________.
A.stop farmers from hunting foxes
B.forbid hunting foxes with dogs
C.stop hunting wild animals in the countryside
D.prevent hunting too many foxes at a time
75.It can be inferred from the passage that ___________.
A.killing foxes with poison is illegal
B.limiting the fox population is unnecessary
C.hunting foxes with dogs is considered cruel and violent
D.fox-hunting often leads to confrontation between the poor and the rich

22.A　what引导表语从句,在从句中充当主语。　
23.A
24.A　本句中she是代词名词化的用法,相当于woman,因此用不定冠词修饰可数名词
25.C　此句考查主谓一致，从句意上看不是过去时态。从are和is中选择。另外定语从句的先行词是team而不是brothers。team表示整体，看作单数。
26.C　此句主要认清是"祈使句加连词再加一般将来时句子"的句型，只不过在or前有一个条件状语从句修饰前面的祈使句。
27.D　本题句意为 "我简直不相信我的眼睛。你交上的作文太差了,里面有那么多的拼写错误"。A项的turn into,意思为 "变成"; turn off意思为 "关(灯、收音机、煤气、自来水等);转弯;辞退"; turn to意思为 "翻到;求助于"; turn in则意思为 "向里弯；歪;上缴；交"。故选D。
28.C　anyone= anybody,指代人; one表示 "一 (本书)"; any one可指人,也可指物;意思为"随便(任何)哪一本"; it指前面出现过的事。根据题意 "我需要一本书仅仅为了打发时间,因此随便什么书都行",答案为C。

30.D　此句的结构为不对称的形容词比较级结构, 故容易忽视。本句句意为"有些事你越为它们辩解, 人们越不愿接受" 。people would…是定语从句,修饰the things。
31.C　spare的意思为 "不用，匀出(给别人)" 。
32.B　根椐答语可以确定事情还未发生, are staying表示将来。
33.A　do指代上文中的seem to be similar to。
34.B　这是两个结构混合在一起。第一个结构为It is + adj.+ for sb.to do…;第二个结构为There be…;两者合起来为: It is + adj.+ for there to be…。　
35.B

39.A　根据下文中or看出句型结构为whether …or…。
40.C　A项的remark后应接介词on/upon; tell "告诉"不符句意; argue后应接介词about; discuss likes and dislikes意思为 "讨论喜欢与不喜欢的事"。
41.B　根据上下文可以看出,要让孩子有一个健康的胃口,就不能让任何人谈论上述话题,因此用anybody。

43.D　take it for granted是固定搭配,表示 "认为……是理所当然的"。
44.C　
45.A　a supposed dislike意思为 "假设的不喜欢"。

49.A　据上文的意思,表示 "不要一下子给他能吃完的量。
50.D　during meal times意思为 "吃饭期间"。
51.B　A项allow不能接不定式作复合宾语,故排除。C、D两项不符句意,只有B项allow表示 "不允许他一吃完饭就离开饭桌"是与下文符合的。
52.B　
53.A　so= so that,引导目的状语从句。
54.D　最后一句的倒装句型说明句首会出现否定意义的词。
55.A　or表示 "或者"。本句句意为 "在任何情况下都不可以哄骗或强迫孩子去吃"。

Report on the Survey about Our School Uniform
I did a survey about our school uniform.I asked some of my classmates what they thought about our uniforms.
The majority like it.55% of them say it is very fashionable and the color is nice.They think it is neat and tidy and suits the student.In some students' opinion, when we wear our school uniforms, we feel equal and no need to follow fashion.
Others don't like the school uniform.Some of them feel it is uncomfortable and the color is too dull.Some consider it old fashioned.In the eyes of others, its style is very simple.The rest of them have no ideas about it.

W:What's your favorite game?
M: I love to play table tennis.How about you?
W: I like swimming and skating.

W: Sure, anytime when you are free.

W: Well, look at the words.Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover.It's dated 1893.Maybe it' s worth something.
M: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents.
W:But if this is the signature of someone who is well known, it might bring a lot more.I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars.
M: Oh? I can hardly read what that one says.Who wrote it?
W: The name looks like "Harold Dobson".Maybe "Dobbins".Wasn't he a politician or something? I'm going to buy this book and see if I can find a name like that in the library.
M:Good luck.Your poetry book may make you rich, but I think my seventy-five-cent mystery is a better buy.

If you only need to travel a short distance, the quickest way to travel in most cities is on foot.During working hours (between approximately 9:00 a.m.and 5 p.m.Monday through Friday) the traffic is very heavy on most city streets, sometimes coming to a complete stop in places.As a result, many people prefer to walk.You should therefore be aware of some of the traffic laws.It is against the law in many cities to cross the street at any place except at the corner.You should not cross the street unless there is a green traffic light facing the direction you plan to cross.In small towns, these rules may not be followed as closely, because the traffic is usually not so heavy.However, the purpose of the laws is to provide for the safety and protection of the people.Remember to look both ways for automobiles when you cross the street.
