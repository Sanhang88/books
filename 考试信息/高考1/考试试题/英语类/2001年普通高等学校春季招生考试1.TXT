新闻记者下面短文，掌握其大意，然后从26~50各题所给的四个选项中，选出一个最佳答案。
People do not analyse every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time thcy had a   26    proble. They often accept the opinion or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without   27   ；they try to find a solution by trial and error   28   .，when all of these methods   29   ，the person with a problem has to start analysing. There are six    30    in analysing a problem.
   31    the person must recognise that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot ride it to class as he usually does.Sam must    32    that there is a problem with his bicycly.
Next the person must   33    the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must know why it does not work. For example, he must   34    the parts that are wrong.
Now the person sust look for   35    that will make the problem clearer and lead to   ___36    solutions. For example, suppose Sam   37    that his bike does not work because there is some thing wrong with the brakes.   38    .he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about brakes,   39    his friends at the bike shop, or look at his brakes crefully.
After   40    the problem, the person should have   41    suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an example   42   ，his suggestions might be：tighten or loosen the brakes; but new brakes and change the old ones.
In the end ,one   43  seems to be the solution   44  the problem. Sometimes the __45__ idea comes quite   46    because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a   47    way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees there is a piece of chewing gum（口香糖）stuck to a brake. He   48    hits on the solution to his proble:he：he must___49___the brake.
Finally the solution is   50   .Sam does it and dinds his bicycle works perfectly. In short he has solved the problem.

III．阅读理解（共25小题。A节每小题2分，B节每小题1分；满分45分）
A）阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项中，选出一个最佳答案。
A
Every year thousands of tourists visit Pompeii, Italy. They see the sights that Pompeii is famous for-its stadium（运动场）and theatres, its shops and restaurants. The tourists do not, however, see Pompeii's people. They do not see them because Pompeii has no people. No one has lived in Pompeii for almost 2000 years.
Once, Pompeii was a busy city of 22000 people. It lay at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, a grass-covered volcano（火山）.Mount Vesuvius had not erupted （喷发）for centuries, so the people of Pompeii felt safe. But they were not.
In August of AD 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted. The entire top of the mountain expolded, and a huge black cloud rose into the air. Soon stones and hot ash began to fall on Pompeii. When the eruption ended two days later, Pompeii was buried under 20 feet of stones and alhes. Almost all of its people were dead.
For centuries, Pompeii lay buried under stone and ash.Then, in the year 1861, an Italian scientist named Ginseppe began to uncover Pompeii. Slowly, carefully, Ginseppe and his men dug. The city looked almost the same as it had looked in AD 79. There were streets and fountains, houses and shops. There was a stadium with 20000 seats. Perhaps the most important of all, there were evryday objects, which tell us a great deal about the people who lived in Pompeii. Many glasses and jars had some dark blue colour in the bottom, so we know that the people of Pompeii liked wine. They liked bread, too; metal bread pans were in every bakery. In one bkery there were 81 round, flat loaves of bread- a type of bread that is still sold in Italy today. Tiny boxes filled with a dark, shiny peoder tell us that women likde to wear eye-makeup.
Ginseppe has died, but his work continues. One-fourth has not been uncovered yet. Scientists are still digging, still making discoveries that draw the tourists to Pompeii.
51．Why do large numbers of people come to Pompeii each year?
A．To visit the volcanoB．To shop and eat there.
C．To watch sports and plays   D．To see how Pompeiians lived.
52．Why had so many Pompeiians remained by volcanic Mount Vesuvius?
A．The city nearby offered ll kinds of fun.
B．The area produced the finest wine in Italy.
C．Few people expected the volcano to erupt again.
D．The mountain was beautiful and covered with grass.
53．Why did the city uncovered look almost the same as it had looked in AD 79?
A．Because Ginseppe and his men dug it slowly and carefully.
B．Because the city was buried alive and remained untouched.
C．Because scientists successfully rebuilt the city with everyday objects.
D．Because nobody had lived in the city ever since the volcano erupted.
54．What do we know about the Pompeiians who lived 2000 years ago?
A．They lived more or less the same as Italians now do.
B．They liked women wearing all kinds of makeup.
C．They enjoyed a lazy life with drinking and eating.
D．They went back to Pompeii after the eruption in AD 79.
B
When I was a boy, I belonged to the Boy Scouts（童子军），so I used to go camping every summer, and once something happened which I have never been able to explain.
We were camping in a place above a river. After arriving, we all rushed down to the river had a swim. Standing by the river, we noticed that it was surrounded（环绕）by cliffs （悬崖）.If someone wanted to reach the river at this point, he had to walk past our camp.
Several days later, the scoutmaster had to he away for a day. That afternoon, we had supper early. We were sitting round the fire, eating and talking, when a man walked past and went down towrds the river. We all felt that this man looked very strange, but, because each of us was afraid of looking very stupid, no one said anything.
We ate rather slowly, taking as long as possible. After finishing, we collected our plates together so that we could take them to the river where we always washed them. But no one moved towards the river- we stood looking at each other ashamed. Then all shouting at once, we began talking about the man who had walked past us. We agreed how strange he looked and we wondered what he could be doing by the river. We knew that he could only return by passing through our camp.
An hour passed. Then one of the boys suggested we should creep（悄悄移动）down by the river so that we could see what the man was doing. Moving very slowly and keeping in the shadow, we crept down towards the bank.One boy climbed a tree so that he could see everythin clearly. He called to us that there was no one there, so we ran down to the bank, looking every-where carefully. We could not understand where the man had gone.
When it got dark, we went back to our camp feeling bewildered. We told the scoutmaster what had happened in the evening. Smiling, he doubted that we had seen the man, but fimally suggested we go and look again. We did, but there was no one there.
Many years have passed, but I still remember it as if it were yesterday. What did we see? I do not know.

I'm seventeen. I had worked as a box boy at a supermarket in Los Angeles. People came to the counter and you put things in their bags for them. And carried things to their cars. It was hard work.
While working, you wear a plate with your name on it. I once met someone I knew years ago. I remembered his name and said,"Mr Castle, how are you?"We talked about this and that. As he left, he said,"I t was nice talking to you, Brett."I felt great, he remembered me. Ther I looked down at my name plate. Oh no. He didn't remember me at all, he just read the name plate. I wish I had put"Irving"down on my name plate. If he'd have said,"Oh yes, Irving, how could I forget you?"I'd have been ready for him. There's nothing personal here.
The manager and everyone else who were a step above above the box boys often shouted orders. One of these was：you couldn't accept tips（小费）.Okay, I'm outside and I put the bags in the car. For a lot of people, the natural reaction（反应）is to take a quarter and give it me. I'd say,"I'm sorry, I can't"They'd get angry. When you give someone a tip,you're sort of being polite. You take a quarter and you put it in their hand and you expect them to say,"Oh, thanks a lot."When you say,"I'm sorry, I can't"they feel a little put down. They say,"No one will know."And they put it in your pocket. You say,"I really can't"It gets to a point where you almost have to hurt a person physically（身体上）to prevent him from tipping you. It was not in agreement with the stor's belief in being friendly. Accepting tips was a friendly thing and made the customer feel good. I just couldn't understand the strangeness of some people's ideas. One lady actually put it in my pocket, got in the car, and drove away. I would have had to throw the quarter at her or eaten it or something.
I had decided that one year was enough. Some people needed the job to stay alive and fed. I guess I had the means and could afford to hate it and give it up.
60．What can be the best title for this text?
A．How Hard Life is for Box Boys
B．Getting along with Customers
C．Why I Gave up My Job
D．The Art of Taking Tips
61．Form the second paragraph, we can infer that________.
A．the writer didn't like the impersonal part of his job
B．with a name plate, people can easily start talking
C．Mr Castle mistook Irving for Brett
D．Irving was the writer's real name
62．The box boy refused to accept tips because_______.
A．customers only gave small tips
B．some customers had strange ideas about tipping
C．the store forbade the box boys to take tips
D．he didn't want to fight with the customers
63．The underlined phrase"put down"in the third paragraph probably means_______.
A．misunderstood   B．defeated   C．hateful   D．hurt
D
You are what you eat. This saying has provided scientists with clues（线索）about the diet of hominids-our early relatives of 3 million years ago.
Studying carbon atoms（碳原子）locked up in tooth enamel（珐琅质）,two researchers argue against the widely held belief that hominids ate little more than fruits and leaves. Sponheimer and Julia Lee-Thorp of the University of Cape Tomn, South Africa, report their findings in Friday's Science.
There aren't many clues for us to know the life of early hominids. The shape of hominids' teeth offered the first clues. Large and flat-edged with thick enamel, they looked perfect for eating nuts and fruits, different from the sharp teeth one would want to tear into meat with. The first stone tools. Which would help in eating meat, didn't appear until about half a million years later.
Scientists have also found marks on hominids' teeth with patterns very similar to those on the teeth of modern-day fruit eaters. Sponheimer and Lee-Thorp tried a new method, looking at the chemical composition of the tooth enamel. They studied the enamel for the carbon-13. Ani-mals that eat grasses have higher carbon-13 levels than those eating fruits and other plants.
What they found was that the teeth of the hominids had an in-between amount of carbon-13, which meant not only they were eating fruits, they were eating a lot of grasses, or animals eating grasses. The lower carbon-13 levels could also come from eating certain types of insects（昆虫）。
But there are people who understand differently. Prof. Ungar of the University of Arkansas agrees the study offers new suggestions of hominid diet, but disagrees about the suggestion that meat could explain the lower carbon-13 levels.
One suggestion might be true though- take good care of your teeth. In 3 million years, a scientist might be using them to figure out what you ate for dinner.
64．Which of the following can be the best title for the text?
A．Protect Your Teeth   B．What the Hominid Ate
C．Where the Hominid lived   D．The Formation of Tooth Eeamel
65．Before the two scientists' findings, most people thought that hominds______
A．lived half a million years ago
B．ate mainly fruits and leaves
C．used tools to dig grass
D．had sharp teeth
66．The two scientists'findings were mainly based on the study about__________
A．the shape of hominids' teeth
B．the teeth marks of early fruit eaters
C．the grasses of 3 million years ago
D．the make-up of the tooth enamel
67．What is it that Prof. Ungar finds doubtful?
A．Hominids possibly ate grass-eating animals.
B．Hominids probably had different diets
C．Hominids were bsically fruit-and grass-eaters.
D．Hominids had lower level of carbon-13 in their teeth.
