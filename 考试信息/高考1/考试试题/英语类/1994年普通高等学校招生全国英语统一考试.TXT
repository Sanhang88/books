I had just gone to bed after a very hard day when the phone rang.It was an 　eccentric(怪僻的)farmer. I had never met him before although I had often heard people 　talk about him. He sounded quite nervous and he had been talking for a minute or so before I understood anything. Even then all I could make out was that someone called Milly had had a very bad accident.I hadn't the slightest idea who she was but I obviously had to go .
It had been snowing heavily that day and I didn't know the way. I had been driving for at least an hour when I finally found his place. He was standing there,waiting for me. It seemed Milly had died."She meant more to me than anyone…even my own wife!" he said. I could see that he had been crying. I thought something terrible had taken place, a possible scandal(丑闻). I was even more shocked when he told me he had put her in the barn(厩)."I wouldn't leave her out in the cold!" he said.
Milly had clearly been a secret lover of his. I was about to tell him he could not expect me to cover anything up when he opened the barn door .He lifted his candle and I saw a dark figure on the ground." She was such a good cow!I wouldn't let anyone but a doctor touch her!" he said, and burst into tears again.

There are different ways in which people try to deal with the problem of energy. One way is the greater production of common energy sources(能源), such as coal, oil and gas. The trouble with these sources, however, is that they are not renewable.
Another way is energy conservation(节能), which means using energy more efficiently(有效地). In some very cold countries people build special houses to save energy. They place materials between the inside and the outside of the walls of the house to keep the cold out and the warmth in. The house is heated by the lights, the body heat of the people and the other equipment in it.
Finally, renewable energy sources are used even though they are often expensive to develop. One form of these is geothermal energy. In certain parts of the world the temperature of the earth increases thirty degrees centigrade with each kilometre down. At six kilometres, therefore, it rises to nearly two hundred degrees. To get the heat, water is pumped(压;抽)down into the rocks and back up to the surface. Heat from the earth is already used in certain countries.
75.How many ways of dealing with the energy problem are discussed in the text?
A.TwoB.Three
C.Four　 D.Five.
76.From the text we learn that coal .
A.is quite easy to produce
B.is not used most efficiently
C.is the most common source of energy
D.could be renewed only by new technology
77.The writer tells about the "special houses" because they
A.show the excellent skills of the builders
B.serve as an example of energy conservation
C.are heated by different sources of energy
D.are warmer than other types of houses
78.The underlined words geothermal energy in the third paragraph mean .
A.renewable source　 B.underground source
C.heat inside the earth　D.temperature of the earth
79.Which of the following drawings shows the right way to get geothermal energy?　




80.At a place where the surface temperature is 15℃, how deep do you have to dig so
　 as to get a temperature of 75℃?
A.One km.B.Two km.
C.Three km.　D.Four km.
