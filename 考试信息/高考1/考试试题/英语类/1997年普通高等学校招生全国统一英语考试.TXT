million students taking part in the Fifth National Hua Luogeng Gold Cup Mathematics Contest

（竞赛）on Tuesday evening. The 20 gold medal winners are all primary and middle school

students under the age of 14. 'Many of the problems are of college level and these pupils

can figure them out. It is just unbelievable!'said a teacher from Guangdong province.

Named after China's most famous mathematician, Hua Luogeng, the contest started in 1986,

In the 1930s, a lot of people in the USA were out of work. Among these people was a man

named Alfred Butts. He always had an interest in word games and so, to fill his time, he

planned a game which he called'Lexico'. However, he was not completely satisfied with the

game, so he made a number of changes to it and, in time, changed its name from 'Lexico'to

'Alph' and then to 'Criss Cross'.He wanted to make some money from his new game but he

didn't have any real commercial（商业性的） success. In 1939, Butts happened to meet a man

called Jim Brunot who showed an interest in the new game. The two men worked together on

developing the game and in 1948 it was offered for sale in the United States under its new

name-'Scrabble'. At first, it didn't sell very well. In the first year it sold just 2,250

sets and by 1951 it had only reached 8,500 sets a year. Then, in 1952 the manager of Macy's

department store in New York,Jack Strauss, happened to play 'Scrabble'while he was on

holiday,He thought it was a wonderful game and,when he went back to work after his holiday,

he insisted that Macy's should stock（储备）the game and make an effort（努力）to call the

public's attention to it. As a result,'scrabble'became a big success in the United States and

it soon spread to Australia and then to other English-speaking countries.

Allan goes everywhere with Birgitta Anderson,a 54-year-old secretary. He moves around her

office at work and goes shopping with her.'Most people don't seem to mind Allan,'says

Birgitta, who thinks he is wonderful. 'He's my fourth child,'she says. She may think of him

and treat him that way, buying his food, paying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact

Allan is a dog. Birgitta and Allan live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to

lead an orderly life according to rules laid down by the government, which also provides

（提供）a high level of care for its people. This level of care costs money. People in

Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren't surprised to find that owning a dog means yet more

taxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to

keep their dog, money that is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical

treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most such treatment is expensive, so owners

often decide to pay health and even life insurance （保险）for their dog. In Sweden dog

owners must pay for any damage （损坏）their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official

explains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car you,

as the owner, have to pay for any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed

in the accident.

America is growing older. Fifty years ago, only 4 out of every 100 people in the United

States were 65 or older. Today, 10 out of every 100 Americans are over 65. The aging of the

population will affect （影响） American society in many ways - education, medicine, and

business.Quietly, the graying of America has made us a very different society- one in which

people have a quite different idea of what kind of behavior （行为）is suitable （合适） at

various ages. A person's age no longer tells you anything about his/her social position,

marriage or health.There's no longer a particular year in which one goes to school or goes to

work or gets married or starts a family. The social clock that kept us on time and told us

when to go to school,get a job,or stop working isn't as strong as it used to be.It doesn't

surprise us to hear of a 29-year-old university president or a 35-year-old grandmother, or

a 70-year-old man who has become a father for the first time. Public ideas are changing. Many

people say, 'I am much younger than my mother - or my father - was at my age.' No one says

'Act your age' anymore. We've stopped looking with surprise at older people who act in

youthful ways.

67. It can be learnt from the text that the aging of the population in America .
A. has made people feel younger B. has changed people's social position
C. has changed people's understanding of age
D. has slowed down the country's social development

A. be active when they are old B. do the right thing at the right age
C. show respect for their parents young or old
D. take more physical exercise suitable to their age

70. If a 25-year-old man becomes general manager of a big firm, the writer of the text

would most probably consider it .
A. normal B.wonderful C.unbelievable D.unreasonable
