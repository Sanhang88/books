Napoleon agreed to plans for a tunnel (隧道) under the English Channel in 1802. The British began digging one in 1880. Neither tunnel was completed. Europe has had to wait until the end of the 20th century for the Channel Tunnel. After nearly two centuries of dreaming, the island of Great Britain is connected to Continental Europe for the first time since the Ice Age, when the two land masses moved apart.
On May 6, 1994, Britain's Queen Elizabeth Ⅱ and France's President Mitterrand carried out the official opening. The Queen was accompanied (陪同) on her train journey through the historic tunnel by one of her Rolls-Royce cars which was placed on the train. The following day saw celebrations taking place in Folkestone and Calais. Regular public services did not start until the latter part of 1994.

About ten men in every hundred suffer from color blindness in some way. Women are luckier, only about one in two hundred is affected in this matter. Perhaps, after all, it is safer to be driven by a woman!
There are different forms of color blindness. In some cases a man can not see deep red. He may think that red, orange and yellow are all shades of green. Sometimes a person cannot tell the difference between blue and green. In rare cases an unlucky man may see everything in shades of green - a strange world indeed.
Color blindness in human beings is a strange thing to explain. In a single eye there are millions of very small things called"cones". These help us to see in a bright light and to tell difference between colors. There are also millions of"rods" but these are used for seeing when it is nearly dark. They show us shape but no color.
Some insects have favorite colors. Mosquitoes (蚊子) like blue but do not like yellow. y red light will not attract insects, but a blue lamp will. In a similar way human beings also have favorite colors. Yet we are lucky. With the aid of the cones in our eyes we can see many beautiful colors by day, and with the aid of the rods we can see shapes at night. One day we may even learn more about the invisible (看不见的) colors around.
63. This passage is mainly about ________.
A．color and its surprising effects
B．women being luckier than men
C．danger caused by color blindness
D．color blindness
64．According to the passage, with the help of the"cones"， we can ________.
A．tell orange from yellow
B．see in weak light
C．kill mosquitoes
D．tell different shapes
65．Why do some people say it is safer to be driven by women?
A．Women are more careful.
B．There are few color-blind women.
C．Women are fonder of driving than men.
D．Women are weaker but quicker in thinking.
66．We can attract and kill mosquitoes by using a ________.
A．red light	B．yellow light
C．blue light	D．green light
D
There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have taught in has ever considered spelling unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, quite different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority (优先) it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is, how to encourage a child to express himself freely in writing without holding him back with spelling.
If spelling becomes the only point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to"play safe". He will write only words within his spelling range (范围). That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability.
I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: "This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling mistakes." It may have been a sharp criticism (批评) of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad thing for the teacher who had omitted (略过)to read the composition, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the mistakes, but if his priority had centred on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more hope to seek improvement.
67．Teachers differ in their opinions about ________.
A．the difficulties in teaching spelling
B．the role of spelling in general language development
C．the importance of the basic writing skills
D．the necessity of teaching spelling
68．The expression "play safe" probably means ________.
A．to write carefully
B．to do as teachers say
C．to use dictionaries frequently
D．to avoid (避免) using words one is not sure of
69．Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that ________.
A．students will be able to express their ideas more freely
B．teachers will have less trouble in correcting mistakes
C．students will have more trust in writing
D．students will learn to spell words correctly
70．The writer seems to think that the teacher's judgement on that sensitive piece of writing is ________.
A．reasonable	B．unfair
C．foolish	D．careless
71．The major point discussed in the passage is ________.
A．the importance of developing writing skills
B．the importance of spelling
C．the correct way of marking composition.
D．the relationship between spelling and the content of a composition
E

Americans often use first names when they meet a stranger and do not always shake hands with each other. They often just smile and say "Hi" or"Hello"instead.
It's good to remember that to an American, such a "Hi" or"Hello" really means the same thing as a polite handshake. Americans do not usually give a handshake to each person when they have a party or business meeting. They will often just wave goodbye to all the people there, saying"Well, so long, everyone. I'll see you tomorrow. " Then they leave without shaking hands.
