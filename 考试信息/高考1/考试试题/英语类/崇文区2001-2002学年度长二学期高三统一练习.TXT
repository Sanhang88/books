Genes are made of a chemical called DNA - the letters stand for deoxyrilbonucleic acid.In the early 1950's .two scientists.Francis Crick and James Watson,figured out how the parts of  DNA fit together. Once scientists understood this structure,it became possible to take pieces of DNA apart and put them together in new ways.New kinds of genes could be made in this manner.
Scientists have studiedt the genes of many plants and animals.They have worked out which genes affect the color of a tomato and the thickness of its skin. Working out which genes determine which features is called genetic mapping,scientists have begun the Human Genome Projet ,an ambitious effort to map all the genes in the human body.
Some genes may be defective .For example,something might be wrong with the gene that makes blood clot (凝聚).An individual born with this defective gene could suffer serious hemorrhages (出血)or even bleed to death because his or her blood fails to clot.If scientists ever child has any defective genes.They might even discover how to treat these genes before the child is born.

Then the driver took me to the cinema.When I paid him,the driver pushed my hand away and said with a smile,"Neither will Iaccept your money."

Good evning. You are listening to Pop World of BCD International. I'm Susam Welch.
Well,first ,I Would like to say a few words to my dear listeners who are not very familiar with this program.
Since many people want to  listen to and understand pop songs,radio producers at BCD International have made hundreds of programs over the years. We have a vast library of " golden old songs "classics,as well as the "latest pop songs."
For those of you who like a bit of backround with your favorite music there's The History of Pop or the road to Music .These two series bring you the language of pop music and information about the periods and the artists.If you want to hear from the artists themselves, there's a new series called About the Big Hits.This is based on interviews with popular singers and songwriters .They talk to us about the meaning and ideas behind their songs.
If you want to understand the words to the big music hits,Pop Words is the program for you. After all it's hard enough for native English speakers to understand most pop songs-so, if English isn't your first language ,you shouldn't be surprised if the words to many songs leave you in dark.
