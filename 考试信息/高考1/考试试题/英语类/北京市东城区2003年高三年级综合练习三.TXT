第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题；每小题2分，满分40分）
阅读下列短文，从每题所给的A、B、C、D四个选项中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
A good modern newspaper is an extraordinary piece of reading. It's remarkable first for what it contains: the range of news from local crime to international politics, from sports to business to fashion to science, and the range of comment and special features (特写) as well, from editorial page to feature articles and interviews to criticism of books, art theatre and music. A newspaper is even more remarkable for the way one reads it: never completely, never straight through, but always by jumping from here to there, in and out, glancing at one piece, reading another article all the way through, reading just a few paragraphs of the next. A good modern newspaper offers a variety to attract many different readers, but far more than any reader is interested in. What brings this variety together in one place is its topicality(时事性)， its immediate relation to what is happening in your world and your locality now. But immediacy and the speed of production that goes with it mean also that much of what appears in a newspeper  has no more than transient(短暂的)value. For all these reasons, not two people really read the same paper: what each person does is to put together, out of the pages of that day's paper, his own selection and sequence, his own newspaper. For all these reasons, reading newspapers efficiently, which means getting what you want from them without missing things you need but without wasting time, demands skill and self-awareness as you modify and apply the techniques of reading.

A. wide coverage  B. uniform style
C. speed in reporting news D. popularity

A. people scan for the news they are interested in

D. people have different views about what a good newspaper is

58 It can be concluded from the passage that newspaper readers _____________.
A. apply reading techniques skillfully
B. jump from newspaper to another
C. appreciate the variety of a newspaper
D. usually read a newspaper selectively

59. The best title for this passage would be ____________.
A. The Importance of Newspaper Topically

People in the United States honor their parents with two special days: Mother's Day, on the second Sunday in May, and Father' s Day, on the third Sunday in June. These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two days offer an opportunity to think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child - care.
These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetry. On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories.

Another tradition is to give cards and gifts. Children make them in school. Many people make their own presents. These are valued more than the ones bought in stores. It is not the value of the gift that is important, but it is "the thought that counts". Greeting card stores, florists, candy makers, bakeries, telephone companies, and other stores do a lot of business during these holidays.

Do you enjoy travelling to other countries? Do you like to see new places, taste new foods, and understand how foreign cultures are different from your own? There is a proverb that goes: When in Rome, do as the Romans do. This means that it is a good idea to try to learn 'the customs of the place you are visiting, and do things in the same way.
If you plan to travel to Japan, it might be helpful to know some Japanese customs about public behavior, eating out and gifts before you go.
Even though you may be familiar with pictures of people in Tokyo crowded into trains during rush hour, bear in mind that people in Japan value their personal space. You might be used to touching someone on the arm or giving a pat on the shoulder, but do not do this in Japan. You greet a person by bowing or nodding, or sometimes by shaking hands.
When eating out, before you start a meal, you should be given a basket a hot towel in it. Use this rowel to wipe your hands and then put it back in the basket. Be sure to wait until the older people at your table pick up their chopsticks before you begin eating.
You will find that gifts are important. Avoid giving four of anything-the word for "four" is similar to the word for "death." All gifts, even money, should be wrapped, but your host will probably not open the gift in front of you in order to show that the act of giving is more important than the actual gift. Use both hands when you give or receive a gift.
