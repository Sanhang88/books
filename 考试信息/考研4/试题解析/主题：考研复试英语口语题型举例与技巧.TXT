关于录取复试时的口试问题！
口试去年一共分3部，总用时大概10分钟！ 
1、自己准备一个introduction!要求脱稿说大约3分钟。 
2、念一篇短文，是到试场以后临时抽题，大约有3分钟的时间提前先看一遍，难度不大！
3、抽题---回答问题。要先念一遍问题，然后回答！ 
全程录音，有A、B、C、D、E五个分值！ 

所要说的是：大家应该先把自己的introduction提前准备好，趁这些天没有事情可做。还有就是看一看，抽到什么问题怎么回答！下面我把我的introduction给大家写一下吧！我口试只得了B，主要是因为最后那个问题没有回答好，对于introduction，老师们应该还是比较满意的！虽然很不好，但是为了大家，我就献丑了！不要扔鸡蛋啊！ 

Good morning/afternoon,my dear teachers: 
my name is CC,23 years old,I graduated from XX University in 1999.I also have an English name.My English name is Stell,that means a star.I take stell as my English name because my Chinese nickname is BeiBei which means star in Chinese. 
I have many hobbies,I like music、chinese chess、sports、and I like English very much I improve my oral and listening ability by listen English songs and watch English 
movies.I passed CET6 this year.But I do think my English is not good enough,so I will do my best to study English. 
Thank you for your attention! 

由于时间长了，记得也不是很清楚，错误再所难免，大家不要见怪啊！其实你如果introduction写的不多就可以念慢一点！这样就可以保证时间了，而且建议一定要自己写，这样自己说出来比较自然，关键是pronunciation!相信每一个口语老师都是最注重这一点的！另外，我抽到的题是：if you are millionaire,how to spend the money! 
我考了两次口试，第一天是外语老师考的，她就是随便问，先都是最简单的东西，最后会有一个很难的问题，好象是关于时事的，让你发表自己的意见。第二天是我们所里的老师，让我用英语谈谈教育的观点！我当时口语考试是这样的，先是selfintroduction,然后抽题目演讲，我抽到的是，“交流能力对学术研究影响大吗？”，说完后，老师就随便问一些问题，主要是关于为什么报考我们学校，为什么选择这个专业，对桂林印象如何等。

Good morning: 
My name is XX, you can also call me Eason,I has such an english name just because the pronunciation of it is like my chinese name. I graduated from this university last year(如果你是考本校的，这一句很重要，一开场就表明自己的身份，我们考的时候，老师拿到的名单只有名字，没有资料，他又不认识你，于是你必须自己说明), and major in computer science, I liked computer very much, especially in multimedia technology, and wanted to make some achievement in this field, but when I finished my school, I realized that what I had learned was not enough for this target, I thought it would be great if I can continue my interest in that, so that was why I choose to further my study with a master degree. 
Well, in my spare time, I like soccer, pop music, and stamp, being a soccer fan, I always show my love to Manchester United and Ryan Giggs is my favorite. I also like English very much, and had passed Band six this year, but I do think it’s still a long way to study it, so I wouldn’t give up my English studying, and improve my oral and listening ability. 
So that’s all, thank you.
