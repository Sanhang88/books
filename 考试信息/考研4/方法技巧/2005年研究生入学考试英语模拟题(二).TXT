　　Recent legal research indicated that incorrect identification is a major factor in many miscarriages(失败) of justice. It also suggests that identification of people by witnesses in a courtroom is not as 1 as commonly believed. Recent studies do not support the 2 of faith judges, jurors, lawyers and the police have in eyewitness evidence.
　　The Law Commission recently published an educational paper, “Total Recall? The Reliability of Witness 3 ”, as a companion guide to a proposed code of evidence. The paper finds that commonly held 4 about how our minds work and how well we remember are often wrong. But while human memory is 5 change, it should not be underestimated.
　　In court witnesses are asked to give evidence about events, and judges and juries 6 its reliability. The paper points out that memory is complex, and the reliability of any person's recall must be assessed 7 Both common sense and research say memory 8 over time. The accuracy of recall and recognition are 9 their best immediately 10 encoding the information, declining at first rapidly, then gradually. The longer the delay, the more likely it is that information obtained after the event wil interfere 11 the original memory, which reduces 12.
　　The paper says 13 interviews or media reports can create such 14 . “People are particularly susceptible to having their memories 15 when the passage of time allows the original memory to 16 , and will be most susceptible if they repeat the 17 as fact.”
   Witnesses may see or read information after the event, then 18 it to produce something 19 than what was experienced, significantly reducing the reliability of their memory of an event or offender, “Further, witnesses may strongly believe in their memories, even though aspects of those memories are 20 false.”

二、阅读理解题(每题1分，共20分)选择下列答案中正确的一个，选择您认为正确的答案

　　Text1
　　The first English settlers in North America were extraordinarily unlucky weather wise, conclude scientists who have looked at centuries of climate data. Their analysis suggests that two early settlements reached crisis points because the colonists arrived during the worst periods of drought in 800 years.
　　The fate of 120 colonists who arrived at Roanoke Island on the North Carolina coast in 1587 has always been a mystery. A supply ship from England docked in 1590 to find the colony abandoned, with few records to explain what had happened. Two decades later, the Jamestown colony in Virginia reported thousands of deaths from starvation, and the settlers came close to abandoning their new home.
　　Historians have long blamed the failure at Roanoke and the problems at Jamestown on inexperience, ineptitude, internal quarreling and hostile natives. But archaeologist Dennis Blanton, of the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Williamsburg, noted that the Jamestown colonists wrote of the local tribes complaining about poor corn crops and decided to see if climate had played a role. He contacted David Stable of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville who uses tree ring data to study climate.
　　Stable's group studied cores from 140 bald cypress trees in Virginia, near the sites of the two colonies. They found that the timing of the unsuspecting colonists could not have been much worse. Jamestown colonists landed in 1607, during the driest seven year period in 770 years, and colony medical records show a close correlation between the severity of drought and mortality. Roanoke Island inhabitants were even more unfortunate. Although their drought was shorter it was even drier, the worst in 800 years.
　　Blanton points out that the Jamestown colonists had counted on trading with the natives for food, and that they had brought copper, a metal prized by local tribes. However, the locals proved reluctant to trade in the face of the drought, leaving the colonists short of food. Drought exaggerated the difficulties between two alien cultures, says Blanton.

三、单项选择题(每题2分，共10分)选择下列答案中正确的一个，选择您认为正确的答案

　　English has become the world's number one language in the 20th century. In every country where English is not the native language，especially in the Third World，people must strive to learn it to the best of their abilities，if they want to participate fully in the development of their countries. 41).
　　Nonetheless，a world full of different languages will disappear if the present trend in many countries to use English to replace the national or official languages in education，trade and even politics continues. 42).
　　The Third World countries that are now using English as a medium of instruction are depriving 75 per cent of their future leaders of a proper education. According to many studies，only around 20 to 25 per cent of students in these countries can manage to learn the language of instruction(English)as well as basic subjects at the same time. Many leaders of these Third World countries are obsessed with English and for them English is everything. They seem to believe that if the students speak English，they are already knowledgeable. 43).
　　All the greatest countries of the world are great because they constantly use their own languages in all national development activities，including education. From a psychological point of view，those who are taught in their own language from the start will develop better self confidence and self reliance. From a linguistic point of view，the best brains can only be produced if students are educated in their own language from the start. 44)　　.
　　There is nothing wrong，however，in learning a foreign language at advanced levels of education. But the best thing to do is to have a good education in one's native language first，then go abroad to have a university education in a foreign language. 45)　.

（本题分值：2分）
【正确答案】
D
 ［A］If this situation continues，the native or official languages of these countries will certainly die within two or three generations. This phenomenon has been called linguistic genocide. A language dies if it is not fully used in most activities，particularly as a medium of instruction in schools.
 ［B］Those who are taught in a foreign language from the start will tend to be imitators and lack self confidence. They will tend to rely on foreign consultants.
 ［C］Suppose you work in a big firm and find English very important for your job because you often deal with foreign businessmen. Now you are looking for a place where you can improve your English，especially your spoken English.
 ［D］But many people are concerned that English's dominance will destroy native languages.
 ［E］These leaders speak and write English much better than their national languages. If these leaders deliver speeches anywhere in the world they use English and they feel more at home with it and proud of their ability as well. The citizens of their countries do not understand their leaders' speeches because they are made in a foreign language.
 ［F］Here are some advertisements about English language training from newspapers. You may find the information you need.
 ［G］A close examination reveals a great number of languages have fallen casualty to English. For example，it has wiped out Hawaiian，Welsh，Scotch Gaelic，Irish，native American languages，and many others. Luckily，some of these languages are now being revived，such as Hawaiian and Welsh，and these languages will live again，hopefully，if dedicated people continue their work of reviving them.

　　When offices are planned the attention paid to the correct use of space, and individual and company needs, is often totally inadequate.46)Bad planning can frustrate the manager and employee and reduce their level of performance. This is why so much research has been undertaken since the war into effective office planning.
　　There is a growing realisation that investment in people means that their needs should be thoroughly analysed and provided for. It has encouraged a number of office planning approaches. 47) The best of these approaches take into account not just the physical aspects of a building but the complex individual and group relationships which need to be understood before a plan is implemented.
　　A man's personal preference is always for his own separate office. Where this can be achieved it provides privacy and special advantages for him. However, it is quite uneconomic for most organisations to provide such facilities on anything but a limited scale.48) Moreover the corporate needs for good communications, smooth exchange of ideas and paper work, and flexibility demand a different form of planning. Preoccupation with rental costs has led in the past to open plan offices which in the worst circumstances are laid out in such a regimented fashion that the atmosphere is totally impersonal.
　　Nevertheless, costs must be faced realistically. Perhaps the best balance between the needs of most of the employees and the needs of the company are to be found in landscaped offices.
　　Developed in Germany in the late 1950s, landscaping, or Burolandschaft as it is sometimes called, seeks to achieve good communications and information flow by the correct juxtaposition of departments. 49) Its aim is to provide a pleasing working environment for all, coupled with economic use of space and the ability on management's part to alter office layout to cope with changes in working methods.
　　Ideally a floor area of not less than 6000 sq. ft. is required, generally in the form of a square or rectangle the sides of which have a ratio of less than two to one. Employees are grouped together in clusters, in accordance with a plan that takes into account work flow and desirable relationships across traditional organisational barriers. Such groups are identified and separated by movable screens. 50) An acceptable general noise level is achieved by careful acoustic control to provide aural privacy and mask intrusive noise.
