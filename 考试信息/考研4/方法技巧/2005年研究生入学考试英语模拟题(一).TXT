　　Perhaps no poet's career was more closely associated with the Imagist(印象派)movement than was that of H.D.(Hilda Doolittle). Her verse, with its precise, clear images, typified the imagists' rebellion against what they perceived as the sentimentalism and careless techniques of nineteenth century poetry.
　　H.D.attended private schools in Philadelphia and then Bryan Mawr College. The love of classical antiquity she acquired during these years later surfaced in the many references in her poetry to figures from Greek and Egyptian mythology and in her classical notions of beauty and form. While in Philadelphia she also began making friendships with Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Harriet Monroe.
　　In 1911, H.D.sailed for Europe, where her career began. Soon after arriving in London, she renewed her friendship with Pound and met and married Richard Aldington, an Imagist poet and novelist who also directly influenced the shape of her writing. She began writing short poems that so impressed Pound with their precise description and diction that he insisted she submit them to Harriet Monroe's Poetry magazine signed “H.D.,Imagist. ”She persisted in using her initials for the remainder of her career closely linked to the Imagist rebellion against more traditional poetry.
　　The clear, spare, and energetic lyrics of H.D.'s early poems, with their classical images, later became fuller, freer, and more “open”philosophic explorations of the world. By the destruction of the Second World War that she witnessed evoked deeper visions of the relationship of ancient truths to modern realities. That vision is expressed in such works as Truiolgy(三部曲)(1946), Helen in Egypt(1961), and her last work, Hermetic Definition(1961).
　　H.D.'s industry and literal achievement are just beginning to be recognized and appreciated. In addition to her poetry, she wrote several novels, including Palimpsest(重写本)(1926), Heylus(1928), and Bid Me to Live(1960). Many of her other poems, essays, and short stories have been published posthumously.21、The main topic of the passage is most probably .

三、单项选择题(每题2分，共10分)选择下列答案中正确的一个，选择您认为正确的答案
　　Long before Man lived on the Earth , there were fishes ,reptiles, birds, insects, and some mammals. Although some of these animals were ancestors of kinds living today ,others are now extinct, that is, they have no descendants alive now . 41)
　　Very occasionally the rocks show impression of skin, so that, apart from color, we can build up a reasonably accurate picture of an animal that died millions of years ago. That kind of rock in which the remains are found tells us much about the nature of the original land ,often of the plants that grew on it, and even of its climate.
　　42) .Nearly all of the fossils that we know were preserved in rocks formed by water action, and most of these are of animals that lived in or near water. Thus it follows that there must be many kinds of mammals, birds, and insects of which we know noting.
　　43) .There were also crablike creatures, whose bodies were covered with a horny substance. The body segments each had two pairs of legs, one pair for walking on the sandy bottom ,the other for swimming. The head was a kind of shield with a pair of compound eyes, often with thousands of lenses. They were usually an inch or two long but some were 2 feet.
　　44) .Of these, the ammonites are very interesting and important .They have a shell composed of many chambers , each representing a temporary home of the animal .As the young grew larger it grew a new chamber and sealed off the previous one .Thousands of these can be seen in the rocks on the Dorset Coast .
　　45) About 75 million years ago the Age of Reptiles was over and most of the groups died out .The mammals quickly developed, and we can trace the evolution of many familiar animals such as the elephant and horse . Many of the later mammals though now extinct ,were known to primitive man and were featured by him in cave paintings and on bone carvings .

【正确答案】
B
 ［A］The shellfish have a long history in the rock and many different kinds are known.
 ［B］Nevertheless , we know a great deal about many of them because their bones and shells have been preserved in the rocks as fossils ,From them we can tell their size and shape ,how they walked ,the kind of food they ate .
 ［C］The first animals with true backbones were the fishes ,first known in the rocks of 375 million years ago .About 300 million years ago the amphibians ,the animals able to live both on land and in water , appeared. They were giant ,sometimes 8 feet long ,and many of them lived in the swampy pools in which our coal seam ,or layer ,or formed .The amphibians gave rise to the reptiles and for nearly 150 million years these were the principal forms of life on land ,in the sea ,and in the air .
 ［D］The best index fossils tend to be marine creature .There animals evolved rapidly and spread over large over large areas of the world .
 ［E］The earliest animals whose remains have been found were all very simple kinds and lived in the sea. Later forma are more complex ,and among these are the sea-lilies , relations of the star fishes ,which had long arms and were attached by a long stalk to the sea bed ,or to rocks .
 ［F］When an animal dies ,the body ,its bones ,or shell ,may often be carried away by streams into lakes or the sea and there get covered up by mud .If the animal lived in the sea its body would probably sink and be covered with mud .More and more mud would fall upon it until the bones or shell become embedded and preserved .
 ［G］Many factors can influence how fossils are preserved in rocks .Remains of an organism may be replaced by minerals, dissolved by an acidic solution to leave only their impression, or simply reduced to a more stable form .

四、翻译题(每题2分，共10分)
　　46)The main impression growing out of twelve years on the faculty of a medical school is that the No.1 health problem in the U. S. today, even more than AIDS or cancer, is that Americans don't know how to think about health and illness. Our reactions are formed on the terror level. We fear the worst, expect the worst, thus invite the worst. The result is that we are becoming a nation of weaklings and hypochondriacs (自疑有病者), a self medicating society incapable of distinguishing between casual, everyday symptoms and those that require professional attention.
　　Somewhere in our early education we become addicted to the notion that pain means sickness. 47) We fail to learn that pain is the body's way of informing the mind that we are doing something wrong, not necessarily that something is wrong. We don't understand that pain may be telling us that we are eating too much or the wrong things; or that we are smoking too much or drinking too much; or that there is too much emotional congestion in our lives; or that we are being worn down by having to cope daily with overcrowded streets and highways, the pounding noise of garbage grinders, or the cosmic distance between the entrance to the airport and the departure gate, we get the message of pain all wrong. 48) Instead of addressing ourselves to the cause, we become pushovers for pills, driving the pain underground and inviting it to return with increased authority.
　　49) Early in life, too, we become seized with the bizarre idea that we are constantly assaulted by invisible monsters called germs, and that we have to be on constant alert to protect ourselves against their fury. Equal emphasis, however, is not given to the presiding fact that our bodies are superbly equipped to deal with the little demons, and that the best way of forestalling an attack is to maintain a sensible life style.
　　The most significant single statement about health to appear in the medical journals during the past decade is by Dr. Franz Ingelfinger, the late and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. Ingelfinger noted that almost all illnesses are self limiting. That is, the human body is capable of handling them without outside intervention.
　　50)The thrust of the article was that we need not feel we are helpless if disease tries to tear away at our bodies, and that we can have greater confidence in the reality of a healing system that is beautifully designed to meet most of its problems.And even when outside help is required, our own resources have something of value to offer in a combined strategy of treatment.
