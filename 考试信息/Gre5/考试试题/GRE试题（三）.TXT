Mary Barton, particularly in its early chapters, is a moving response to the suffering of the industrial worker in the England of the 1840's.What is most impressive about the book is the intense and painstaking effort made(5)by the author, Elizabeth Gaskell, to convey the experience of everyday life in working-class homes.Her method is partly documentary in nature.the novel includes such features as a carefully annotated reproduction of dialect, the exact details of food prices in an account of a tea(10)party, an itemized description of the furniture of the Bartons' living room, and a transcription (again annotated)of the ballad "The Oldham Weaver." The interest of this record is considerable, even though the method has a slightly distancing effect.(15)As a member of the middle class, Gaskell could hardly help approaching working-class life as an outside observer and a reporter, and the reader of the novel is always conscious of this fact.But there is genuine imaginative re-creation in her accounts of the walk in Green (20)Heys Fields, of tea at the Bartons' house, and of John Barton and his friend's discovery of the starving family in the cellar in the chapter "Poverty and Death." Indeed, for a similarly convincing re-creation of such families' emotions and responses (which are more crucial than the (25)material details on which the mere reporter is apt to concentrate), the English novel had to wait 60 years for the early writing of D.H.Lawrence.If Gaskell never quite conveys the sense of full participation that would completely authenticate this aspect of Mary Barton, she (30)still brings to these scenes an intuitive recognition of feelings that has its own sufficient conviction.The chapter "Old Alice's History " brilliantly dramatizes the situation of that early generation of workers brought from the villages and the countryside to the (35)urban industrial centers.The account of Job Legh, the weaver and naturalist who is devoted to the study of biology, vividly embodies one kind of response to an urban industrial environment.an affinity for living things that hardens, by its very contrast with its environ(40)ment,into a kind of crankiness.The early chapters®Dabout factory workers walking out in spring into Green Heys Fields; about Alice Wilson, remembering in her cellar the twig- gathering for brooms in the native village that she will never again see; about Job Legh, intent on (45)his impaled insects®D capture the characteristic responses of a generation to the new and crushing experience of industrialism.The other early chapters eloquently portray the development of the instinctive cooperation with each other that was already becoming an important tradition among workers.

As of the late 1980's.neither theorists nor largescale computer climate models could accurately predict whether cloud systems would help or hurt a warming globe.Some studies suggested that a four percent (5)increase in stratocumulus clouds over the ocean could compensate for a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide, preventing a potentially disastrous planetwide temperature increase.On the other hand, an increase in cirrus clouds could increase global warming.(10)That clouds represented the weakest element in climate models was illustrated by a study of fourteen such models.Comparing climate forecasts for a world with double the current amount of carbon dioxide, researchers found that the models agreed quite well if clouds were (15)not included.But when clouds were incorporated, a wide range of forecasts was produced.With such discrepancies plaguing the models, scientists could not easily predict how quickly the world's climate would change, nor could they tell which regions would face dustier droughts or deadlier monsoons.
24.The author of the passage is primarily concerned with 
(A)confirming a theory 
(B)supporting a statement 
(C)presenting new information 
(D)predicting future discoveries

25.It can be inferred that one reason the fourteen models described in the passage failed to agree was that 
(A)they failed to incorporate the most up-to-date information about the effect of clouds on climate 
(B)they were based on faulty information about factors other than clouds that affect climate.
(C)they were based on different assumptions about the overall effects of clouds on climate 
(D)their originators disagreed about the kinds of forecasts the models should provide 
(E)their originators disagreed about the factors other than clouds that should be included in the models 
26.It can be inferred that the primary purpose of the models included in the study discussed in the second paragraph of the passage was to 
(A)predict future changes in the world's climate 
(B)predict the effects of cloud systems on the world's climate 
(C)find a way to prevent a disastrous planetwide temperature increase 
(D)assess the percentage of the Earth's surface covered by cloud systems 
(E)estimate by how much the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere will increase 
27.The information in the passage suggests that scientists would have to answer which of the following questions in order to predict the effect of clouds on the warming of the globe? 
(A)What kinds of cloud systems will form over the Earth?
(B)How can cloud systems be encouraged to form over the ocean? 
(C)What are the causes of the projected planetwide temperature increase?
