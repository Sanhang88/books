Although the hormone adrenaline is known to regulate memory storage, it oes not pass from the blood into brain cells.We are faced with an pparent paradox: how can a hormone that does not act directly on the brain have such a (5)large effect on brain function?Recently, we tested the ossibility that one of the hormone's actions outside the brain might be responsible.Since one consequence of adrenaline release in an animal is an increase in blood glucose levels, we examined the (10)effects of glucose on memory in rats.We found that glucose injected immediately after training enhances memory tested the next day.Additional evidence was provided by negative findings: drugs called adrenergic antagonists, which block peripheral adrenaline receptors, disrupted (15)adrenaline's ability to regulate memory but did not affect memory enhancements produced by glucose that was not stimulated by adrenaline.These results are as they should be if adrenaline affects memory modulation by increasing blood glucose levels.
17.The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A)reconcile two opposing theories 
(B)compare two different explanations for a phenomenon 
(C)describe experimental research that appears to support an unpopular heory 
(D)present evidence that may help to resolve an apparent contradiction
(E)describe a hypothesis that has cause a controversy
18.It can be inferred from the passage that the author would most likely describe the "additional evidence" (line 12)provided by experiments with drenergic antagonists as 
(A)revolutionary 
(B)disappointing 
(C)incomplete 
(D)unexpected 
(E)corroborative 
19.The passage provides information about which of the following topics?
(A)The mechanism by which glucose affects memory storage 
(B)The evidence that prompted scientist to test the effects of adrenaline on memory regulation 
(C)The reason that the effects of glucose on memory were tested 
(D)The ways that memory storage modifies the structure of the brain 
(E)The kinds of training used to test memory enhancement in rats 
20.The author refers to the results of the experiment using adrenergic antagonists as "negative findings" (line 13) most likely because the adrenergic antagonists
(A)failed to disrupt adrenaline's effect on memory 
(B)did not affect glucose's ability to enhance memory.
(C)did not block adrenaline's ability to increase blood glucose levels 
(D)only partially affected adrenaline's ability to enhance memory 
(E)disrupted both adrenaline's and glucose's effect on memory 
The age at which young children begin to make moral discriminations about harmful actions committed against themselves or others has been the focus of recent research into the moral development of children.Until recently,(5)child psychologists supported pioneer developmentalist Jean.Piaget in his hypothesis that because of their immaturity,children under age seven do not take into account the intentions of a person committing accidental or deliberate harm,but rather simply assign punishment for transgressions on (10)the basis of the magnitude of the negative consequences caused.According to Piaget, children under age seven occupy the first stage of moral development, which is characterized by moral absolutism (rules made by authorities must be obeyed)and imminent justice (if rules are broken,(15)punishment will be meted out).Until young children mature,their moral judgments are based entirely on the effect rather than the cause of a transgression.However, in recent research, Keasey found that six- year-old children not only distinguish between accidental and intentional harm, but (20)also judge intentional harm as naughtier,regardless of the amount of damage produced.Both of these findings seem to indicate that children, at an earlier age than Piaget claimed, advance into the second stage of moral development, moral autonomy, in which they accept social rules (25)but view them as more arbitrary than do children in the first stage.Keasey's research raises two key questions for develop-mental psychologists about children under age seven: do they recognize justifications for harmful actions, and do (30)they make distinctions between harmful acts that are preventable and those acts that have unforeseen harmful consequences? Studies indicate that justifications excusing harmful actions might include public duty,self-defense, and provocation.For example, Nesdale and Rule concluded that (35)children were capable of considering whether or not an aggressor's action was justified by public duty: five year olds reacted very differently to "Bonnie wrecks Ann's pretend house" depending on whether Bonnie did it "so somebody won't fall over it" or because Bonnie wanted "to (40)make Ann feel bad."Thus, a child of five begins to understand that certain harmful actions, though intentional, can be justified; the constraints of moral absolutism no longer solely guide their judgments.Psychologists have determined that during kindergarten (45)children learn to make subtle distinctions involving harm.Darley observed that among acts involving unintentional harm, six-year-old children just entering kindergarten could not differentiate between foreseeable, and thus preventable, harm and unforeseeable harm for which the perpetrator (50)cannot be blamed.Seven months later, however, Darley found that these same children could make both distinctions, thus demonstrating that they had become morally autonomous.

26.It can be inferred form the passage that Piaget would be likely to agree with which of the following statements about the punishment that children under seven assign to wrongdoing? 
(A)The severity of the assigned punishment is determined by the perceived magnitude of negative consequences more than by any other factor.
