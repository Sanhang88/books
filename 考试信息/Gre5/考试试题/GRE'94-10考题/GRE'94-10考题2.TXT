United States automobile manufacturers have been steadily losing United States market share to foreign manufacturers.Now a study has found that advertisements for foreign automobiles hold United States consumers' attention better than advertisements for domestically made automobiles do.Therefore, United States automobile manufacturers will increase market share by giving top priority to revamping their advertising campaigns.　 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
People who are considering buying a new automobile pay more attention to advertisements for automobiles than do people who are not planning to buy an automobile in the near future.
Consumers tend to pay closer attention to advertisements for products they already prefer than to advertisements for other products.
United States manufacturers of automobiles currently spend about as much on advertising each of their new models as foreign automobile manufacturers do.
In the United States, even though sales of foreign-made automobiles are increasing, annual sales have been consistently greater for domestically made than for foreign-made new automobiles.
Some of the advertising for foreign automobiles in the United States is designed and produced by United States advertising agencies.

Since the beginning of the current economic recession.Reelcorp's factories have operated with a reduced work force.Now, with the economy improving, the weekly volume of new orders being received by Reelcorp's factories has increased substantially.Reelcorp's inventories of completed goods are currently very low.Therefore, if Reelcorp is to fill its orders without delay, it must begin increasing its work force immediately.　 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument above? 
One of the ways a corporation can increase its work force is to rehire former employees who had been laid off.
Reelcorp's work force has a greater proportion of highly experienced factory workers today than it had when the recession began.The workers who are, currently employed at Reelcorp's factories are now working the maximum weekly number of hours permitted by the workers' contract.
Nearly all of the products manufactured at Reelcorp's factories use components that Reelcorp purchases from other manufacturers.
Formal agreements in force at Reelcorp's factories permit supervisory personnel to fill in for certain assembly-line workers whenever the need arises.
答案：(C) 
问题：下面那一个，if true，最帮助加强上面的论述？ 
读题：从经济萧条一开始，Reelcorp的工厂就压缩劳动力。如今随着经济复苏，每周收到 
　　　的订货单大大增加，而已完成货物的库存目前非常少。所以，如果Reelcorp打算按 
　　　时交货，就必须尽快增加人手。 
分析：原来经济萧条，人少；现在订货单增加，库存少，因此增加人手 
Strengthen达到效果，的确需要增加人 
a.　公司增加其劳动力的方法是雇佣他们以前辞退的人 
　（题目中问的是，为什么要增加，而不是如何增加？） 
b.　今天Reelcorp的熟练工人要比经济萧条开始时多。 
c.　目前在Reelcorp工厂中工人的工作时间已达到工人合同中规定的最长工作时间。 
　（现有工人已经忙不过来了，需要增加人） 
e.　正式劳动协议规定，一旦需要，主管人员就要加入工人流水线工作。 
A chemical present in all grapes helps reduce blood cholesterol in humans.The chemical is also present in red wine and grape juice.but not in white wine.Both red wine and grape juice are produced using whole grapes; white wine is produced without using the grape skins.
The information above, if true.most strongly supports which of the following conclusions? 
Regular consumption of alcoholic substances such as red or white wine can substantially reduce blood cholesterol.
Eating whole fruit is more likely to reduce blood cholesterol than is drinking juice made from whole fruit.
The skins of red grapes but not of other grapes contain the chemical that reduces blood cholesterol.
The chemical that reduces blood cholesterol is found in the skins but not in other parts of grapes.
The chemical that reduces blood cholesterol is present only in beverages, rather than solid foods, that are made from grapes.

如果2,3=w, 则环上包括： 
7 1 2 3 
r w w 
从条件无从下手,可以排除,举反例排除 
A:完全可以取出有g的例子,A错 
B:如果只有2个W,那么余下的位置只能在(g,r)中选颜色 
由～(gr),可以得出7为r,依次类推,则4,5,6也都为r,所以其实一共就用了两种颜色，2个w,5个r, 而一共有３种shape, 并且条件2有所有描绘相同形状的panel不能够为同一种颜色, 这样一来至少有一种shape不能够满足条件2, 所以一定不止2个W, B对

The Whitley Township School Board plans to continue offering Latin courses at Whitley High School despite low enrollment in these courses.
The board argues that the high cost of Latin courses is justified by the great benefit that taking Latin courses can give to students who need to improve their English skills.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the school board's argument? 
The school's Latin teacher is capable of teaching Spanish and could be reassigned to Spanish, which is a more popular course.
Students in need of improving their English skills can benefit just as much from taking courses in other languages as from taking Latin.
Most students who perform well in Latin courses also perform well in other courses.
Some students who perform well in English courses do not perform well in Latin courses.
Because Latin is no longer commonly spoken anywhere in the modern world, even scholars cannot be certain of its proper pronunciation.

问题：下面那一个，if true，最严重地削弱校董事会的论述？ 
读题：Whitley Fownship校董会计划继续在Whitley高中教授拉丁课，尽管上这门课的人极少，校董会认为，拉丁文课收费很高被证明是恰当的，上拉丁文课能够使需要提高英语技巧的人获益。 
分析：第二行by引导原因，上拉丁文课能够提高英语技巧用此原因来论证了拉丁文课的高收费是恰当的 
b.需要提高英语技巧的学生可以从其它语言课上学到同样的东西。 
　（论据不足以支持就必须上拉丁文课） 
The United States usable geothermal energy-volcanic heat energy trapped below the surface-exceeds the energy potential of all domestic fossil-fuel reserves.The technology will soon exist to transform the geothermal heat accessible in certain areas into clean and safe electrical energy.An energy shortage in the United States during the next century can therefore be averted.　 
Which of the following, if true, casts the most serious doubt on the argument made above? 
Geothermal energy is a potentially unlimited form of energy, derived from the heat of the Earth's molten core.
Sometime in the next century, exhaustion of the usable fossil-fuel reserves of the continental United States will force increased reliance on imported energy sources.
Some scientists believe that an energy shortage can be averted by improving energy efficiency and encouraging energy conservation.
Transmission of electrical energy over great distances, such as those between geothermal energy sources and most areas of high population density, is impractical.
Any method of producing electrical energy requires the expenditure of some energy in the production process.
答案：(D) 
A person's intake of refined sugar and of foods that break down into sugars during digestion is the dietary source of virtually all of the glucose (a type of sugar) that reaches that person's bloodstream.Coffee, however, which itself does not break down into sugars during digestion, sometimes causes a person's blood-glucose level to rise dramatically, even if the coffee is consumed without cream or any sweeteners.
Which of the following, if true, best helps to explain coffee's effect on blood-glucose levels as it is described above? 
People often drink coffee after a meal consisting of several types of foods that themselves rapidly break down into sugars during digestion.
Drinking more than two cups of coffee in an hour increases a person's level of stress, and the body reacts to stress by releasing stored glucose into the blood.
People who eat very few foods that contain refined sugar often have higher blood-glucose levels than people who eat many such foods.
For many people, the consumption of one piece of chocolate cake has the same stimulating effect as one cup of plain coffee.
People with sedentary office jobs are more likely to drink large amounts of coffee and to have higher blood-glucose levels than are people with jobs requiring constant physical activity.
答案：(B) 
问题：下面那一个，if true，最帮助解释咖啡对葡萄糖浓度的作用? 
读题：人直接吸收的糖及人在消化过程中由食物分解而成的糖是进入人血管的葡萄糖的来源。但是，虽然咖啡在消化过程中并不分解为糖，有时候也可以使人体内的葡萄糖浓度急剧上升，尽管喝咖啡时并没有吃奶油或其它甜食。 
A.在吃过饭后，这顿饭是由几种在消化时迅速分解为糖的食物组成的，人们常常喝咖啡。 
　（喝咖啡只是一种习惯，起作用的还是饭中的食物） 
B.一小时内喝超过2杯咖啡，就会增加人的压力程度，人体对压力情绪的反应是把储存的葡萄糖释放到血液中。 
　（介绍咖啡是如何起作用的）　 
C.极少吃含糖食物的人往往比喜欢吃含糖食物的人的血浓度还要高。 
D.对于许多人来讲，吃一块巧克力蛋糕与喝杯咖啡具有同样的刺激效果。 
E.常坐办公室的人与从事体力劳动的人相比，前者更有可能喝大量的咖啡,含糖浓度更高 
　The use of nets at beach resorts to protect swimming areas from sharks 
has been criticized by environmentalists because the nets needlessly kill 
thousands of marine animals annually.However, environmentalists have 
recently discovered that an electrified cable buried beneath the periphery 
of swimming areas causes sharks to swim away while harming neither humans 
nor marine life.Hence, by installing such cables, resort communities 
will be able to maintain tourism while satisfying environmentalists' 
concerns.
　 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
Many seaside resort communities where sharks have never been sighted 
　nonetheless plan to install the new technology.
Tourism at resorts where sharks have been sighted has suffered only 
　slightly despite the fact that most people claim to fear sharks.
Most tourists are unlikely to visit beaches where swimmers cannot 
　actually see the barrier that protects them from sharks.
The buried cable is not the only innovation approved by environmentalists 
　that is known to be successful in repelling sharks without harming them.
The electrical current produced by the buried cable repels many kinds 
　of fish but not the marine mammals that are a tourist attraction at 
　many resorts.

Mathematics instructors assigned some of the students enrolled in a 
calculus course to participate in a small student-led group-study workshop.
Since workshop participants achieved a significantly higher average course 
grade than those who did not participate, the mathematics department 
attributes this superior performance in calculus to workshop participation.
　 
The mathematics department's reasoning, as described above, assumes 
which of the following? 

Calculus is a difficult subject for instructors to teach to large 
groups of students.
The students who participated in the workshop were initially neither 
much better prepared nor much more highly motivated than the students 
who did not participate in the workshop.
The time spent in the calculus workshop did not have a significantly 
adverse effect on the participants' performance in their other courses.
Few of the students who participated in the workshop planned to enroll 
in any mathematics courses more advanced than calculus.
The students who participated in the workshop received much more 
individualized attention from the calculus instructor than did the 
students who did not participate in the workshop.

答案：(E) 

Whole wheat bread is more nutritious than white bread,which has a 
taste that many people prefer.Bread made from whole-grain white wheat 
flour, newly available, provides nutrition comparable to whole wheat 
bread but tastes just like white bread.Once consumers try whole-grain 
white wheat bread, they will prefer eating it to eating white bread.
　 
The conclusion of the argument above is properly drawn if which of 
the following is assumed? 

Whole-grain white wheat flour costs consumers more than does white 
　flour but less than does whole wheat flour.
Consumers will prefer eating foods that are more nutritious to eating 
　foods that are less nutritious when the foods taste the same.
Ordinary white flour is made by removing the nutritious bran and germ 
　from ground wheat.
Whole-grain white wheat flour is not significantly more difficult 
　to produce than is white flour.
Some people prefer the taste of whole wheat bread to that of white bread.

cannot produce much snowfall.In recent years, air masses in both 
polar regions have been, without exception, extremely cold.
　 
The information above most strongly supports which of the following 
conclusions? 

If polar ice is currently growing and expanding at all, it is doing so 
　only slowly.
If air temperatures in the polar regions were considerably warmer, 
　much polar ice would melt off.
In the last few years, snowfall in the polar regions has been virtually 
　continuous.
The thicker the polar ice is, the colder the air masses that are in 
　contact with it.
For snow to turn into ice in the polar regions, the air has to be 
　extremely cold.

答案：(A) 

问题：上述信息支持下面那一个结论？ 
读题：几乎所有的极地冰都是由降雪形成的，极冷的空气无法维持太多湿气，结果就无法 
　　　产生许多雪。近年来，两极的气团都毫无例外地变得极冷。 
　 
分析：极冷的空气导致没有太多湿气，导致没有雪， 
　　　而极地冰由降雪形成，没有雪就没有冰 
　　　现在空气冷 
　 
A.如果极地冰正处于增厚与膨胀中，这种速度也是极慢的。 
　　（可以由上面的分析推出） 
　 
B.如果极地地区气温相当高，许多极地冰就会融化。 
　　（这句话本身没有错，但是上文没有说到这一方面） 
　 
C.在过去几年里，极地地区降雪不断。 
D.极地冰越厚，与之接触的气团越冷。 
E.在极地地区，若雪要就冰的话，空气必须极冷才行。 
三、Moas were tall, flightless birds that lived only in New Zealand.
Before humans settled in New Zealand, moas had no serious predators and 
were plentiful.Moas became extinct after humans began hunting them.
So hunting by humans must have caused the moas' extinction.
　 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above? 

Some moa species lived in parts of New Zealand that were among the 
　last to be settled by humans.
Humans in New Zealand hunted a mammalian species that, though vulnerable 
　to indigenous predators, never became extinct.
Humans introduced to New Zealand several animal species that preyed 
　on moas.
Moas still existed in some parts of New Zealand approximately 500 years 
　after the arrival of the first humans in New Zealand.
Some species of moa were able to outrun humans.

------------------------ 
答案：(C) 

问题：下面那一个，if true，最严重削弱上面的论述？ 
读题：Maos是仅存在于新西兰的一种高大但不会飞的鸟。在人定居新西兰之前，Maos没有 
　　　什么可怕的天敌，数量极多。当人们开始猎取它们后，Maos几乎绝迹了。所以， 
　　　肯定是人类的打猎造成了Maos的绝迹。 
　 
分析：上面是一个事实，Maos绝迹；认为人类的打猎是原因。 
反对：　1、有其他的原因导致其绝迹 
　 2、直接说人类的打猎和Maos绝迹无关。 
　 
A.一些Maos栖息在新西兰人类定居最晚的一部分地区。 
B.新西兰人也猎取一种哺乳动物。这种动物虽然也易受本地天敌的攻击，却并未灭绝。 
C.人们引入新西兰好几种捕食Maos的动物。 
　　（不是打猎造成的，而是动物捕杀） 
　 
D.大约第一批人进驻新西兰500年之后，Maos仍存在于新西兰的某些地区。 

　 During six days, Monday through Saturday, a walker is planning to 
take five walks-the gorge walk, the lake walk, the pinewoods walk.the 
river walk, and the village walk-at a mountain resort.The village 
walk requires two entire consecutive days; the other four walks each 
require exactly one entire day.The walker's plans will conform to 
the following constraints, imposed by the nature of the walks: 
　 
　The gorge walk must be planned for Monday or else for Tuesday.
　Friday and Saturday cannot be the pair of days for which the village 
　　walk is planned.
　The lake walk can be planned for neither the day before nor the day 
　　after the village walk.
If the walker's plan includes the pinewoods walk for Wednesday, 
which of the following must the plan also include? 
The gorge walk for Monday 
The lake walk for Monday 
The lake walk for Tuesday 
The river walk for Saturday 
The village walk for a pair of days that include Tuesday 

------------------------ 
答案：(D) 

If the walker's plan includes the pinewoods walk for Tuesday, which 
of the following CANNOT be included in that plan? 
The lake walk for Monday 
The lake walk for Friday 
The pinewoods walk for Monday 
The pinewoods walk for Wednesday 
The river walk for Monday 

------------------------ 
答案：(B) 

If the walker's plan includes the pinewoods walk and the river walk, in 
that order, on consecutive days, then those two days must be the two 
days that 
follow the gorge walk 
follow the lake walk 
follow the village walk 
precede the lake walk 
precede the village walk 

------------------------ 
答案：(C) 

Which of the following is a complete and accurate list of days for 
any one of which the walker can plan a lake walk? 
Monday, Tuesday 
Monday, Tuesday, Friday 
Tuesday, Friday, Saturday 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday 
Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday 

------------------------ 
答案：(E) 

If the walker's plan assigns the lake walk to some day before the 
village walk, the plan must also assign the 
lake walk to some day before the gorge walk 
lake walk to some day before the pinewoods walk 
pinewoods walk to some day before the river walk 
pinewoods walk to some day before the village walk 
river walk to some day before the village walk 

------------------------ 
答案：(B) 

Which of the following is true about the walker's plan? 
The gorge walk must be planned for some day before the village walk.
The gorge and lake walks must be planned for consecutive days.
The pinewoods and river walks must be planned for consecutive days.
The village walk must be planned for Wednesday.
The lake walk or the pinewoods walk must be the walk planned for Saturday.

答案：(A) 

　A police captain is making patrol assignments for six officers-King, 
Lee, Morales, Nini, O'Hagan, and Paredes.Two of the officers will be 
assigned to car 1.and another three will be assigned to car 2.The 
remaining officer will be on desk duty.The following restrictions on 
assignments apply: 
　 
　King can only be assigned to a car if O'Hagan is also assigned to that car.
　Neither Lee nor Nini can be assigned to car 1.
　Lee cannot be assigned to the same car as Paredes.
Which of the following can be the pair of officers assigned to car 1? 
King and Morales 
King and O'Hagan 
Lee and O'Hagan 
Lee and Paredes 
Morales and Nini 

------------------------ 
答案：(B) 
读题：一个警官分配6个officer巡逻，K、L、M、N、O、P，2个在car 1, 3个在car 2, 
　　　留下的一个为duty 
写条件： 
　　　1、 K→KO （表示仅仅当O在某车上，K才能够在那辆车上） 
2、 L,N≠1 （表示 L,N不在1） 
3、 ～(LP) （表示L和P不再一组） 
　 
分析: 
方法1 
由K→KO可以把本题分为三种情况 
*1: K在第一组 
1:KO 
2:N,L/P,M 
duty:L/P 
*2:K在第二组 
1: PM 
2: L/N KO 
duty: L/N 
*3: K在duty 
1: P O/M 
2: LN O/M 
duty:K 
　 
　 
*** 方法2 
一共相当于3组, 其数字分配为2,3,1 
现在L,N≠1, 因此就一定在第二组或者作为duty, 而duty只有一人,因此L,N之中一定至少有 
一人在第二组 

If Lee is the officer assigned to desk duty, which of the following 
officers must be assigned to car 2? 
King 
Morales 
Nini 
O'Hagan 
Paredes
