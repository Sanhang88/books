Directions: Each passage in this group is followed by questions based on its content.After reading a passage, choose the best answer to each question.Answer all questions following a passage on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage.
(This passage was written prior to 1950.)
In the long run a government will always encroach upon .freedom to the extent to which it has the power to do so; this is almost a natural law of politics, since, whatever the intentions of the people who exercise political power, the sheer momentum of government leads to a constant pressure upon the liberties of the citizen.But in many countries society has responded by throwing up its own defenses in the shape of social classes or organized corporations which, enjoying economic power and popular support, have been able to set limits to the scope of action of the executive.Such, for example, in England was the origin of all our liberties-won from government by the stand first of the feudal nobility, then of churches and political parties, and latterly of trade unions, commercial organizations, and the societies for promoting various causes.Even in European lands which were arbitrarily ruled, the powers of the monarchy, though absolute in.theory, were in their exercise checked in a similar fashion.Indeed the fascist dictatorships of today are the first truly tyrannical governments which Western Europe has known for centuries, and they have been rendered possible only because on coming to power they destroyed all forms of social organization which were in any way rivals to the state.
17.The passage can most accurately be described as a discussion of the.
(A)limited powers of monarchies
(B)ideal of liberal government
(C)functions of trade unions
(D)ruthless methods of dictators
(E)safeguards of individual liberty
18.According to the passage, the natural relationship between government and individual liberty is one of
(A)marked indifference
(B)secret collusion
(C)inherent opposition
(D)moderate complicity
(E)fundamental interdependence 
19.Fascist dictatorships differ from monarchies of recent times in
(A)setting limits to their scope of action
(B)effecting results by sheer momentum .
(C)rivaling the state in power
(D)exerting constant pressure on liberties
(E)eradicating people's organizations 
20.The passage suggests which of the following about fascist dictatorships?
(A)They represent a more efficient form of the executive.
(B)Their rise to power came about through an accident of history.
(C)They mark a regression to earlier despotic forms of government.
(D)Despite superficial dissimilarities, they are in essence like absolute monarchies.
(E)They maintain their dominance by rechanneling opposing forces in new directions.
Yet, while Darwinian theory extends its domain, some of its cherished postulates are slipping, or at least losing their generality.The "modem synthesis," the contemporary version of Darwinism that has reigned for thirty years, took the model of adaptive gene substitution within local populations as an adequate account, by accumulation and extension, of life's entire history.The model may work Well in its empirical domain of minor, local, adaptive adjustment; populations of the moth Biston betularia did turn black, by substitution of a single gene, as a selected response for decreased visibility on trees that bad been blackened by industrial soot.
8ut is the origin of a new species simply this process extended to more genes and greater effect? Are larger evolutionary trends within major lineages just a 81rther accumulation of sequential adaptive changes ? 
Many evolutionists (myself included)are beginning to challenge this synthesis and to assert the hierarchical view that different levels of evolutionary change often reflect different kinds of causes.Minor adjustment within populations may be sequential and adaptive.But speciation may occur by major chromosomal changes that.establish sterility with other species for reasons unrelated to adaptation.Evolutionary trends may represent a kind of higher-level selection upon essentially static species themselves, not the slow and steady alteration of a single large population through untold ages.
Before the modem synthesis, many biologists (see Bateson, 1922, in bibliography)expressed confusion and depression because the proposed mechanisms of evolution at different levels seemed contradictory enough to .preclude a unified science .After the modem synthesis, the notion spread (amounting almost to a dogma among its less thoughtful lieutenants)that all evolution could be reduced to the basic Darwinism of gradual, adaptive change within local populations.I think that we are now pursuing a fruitful path between the anarchy of Bateson's day and the restriction of view imposed by the modem synthesis.The modem synthesis works in its appropriate arena, but the same Darwinian processes of mutation and selection may operate in strikingly different ways at higher domains in a hierarchy of evolutionary levels .I think that we may hope for uniformity of causal agents, hence a single, general theory with a Darwinian core.But we mast reckon with a multiplicity of mechanisms that preclude the explanation of higher level phenomena by the model of adaptive gene substitution favored for the lowest level.
At the basis of all this ferment lies nature's irreducible complexity.Organisms are not billiard balls, propelled by simple and measurable external forces to predictable new positions on life's pool table.Sufficiently complex systems have greater richness.Organisms have a history that constrains their future in myriad, subtle ways.Their complexity of form entails a host of functions incidental to whatever pressures of natural selection superintended the initial construction.Their intricate and largely unknown pathways of embryonic development guarantee that simple inputs (minor changes in timing, for example)may be translated into marked and surprising changes in output (the adult organism).
Charles Darwin chose to close his great book with a striking comparison that expresses this richness .He contrasted the simpler system of planetary motion, and its result of endless, static cycling, with the complexity of life and its wondrous and unpredictable change through the ages: 
There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.
