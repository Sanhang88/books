　　　Although, recent years have seen
　　substantial reductions in noxious
　　pollutants from individual motor
　　vehicles, the number of such vehicles
(5) has been steadily increasing conse-
　　quently, more than 100 cities in the
　　United States still have levels of
　　carbon monoxide, particulate matter,
　　and ozone (generated by photochemical,
(10) reactions with hydrocarbons from
　　vehicle exhaust) that exceed legally
　　established limits.There is a growing,
　　realization that the only effective
　　way to achieve, further reductions in
(15) vehicle emissions-short of a massive
　　shift away from the private automobile-
　　is to replace conventional diesel fuel
　　and gasoline with cleaner burning fuels
　　such as compressed natural gas,liquefied
(20) petroleum gas, ethanol, or methanol.
　　　All of these alternatives are carbon-
　　based fuels whose molecules are smaller
　　and simpler than those of gasoline.
　　These molecules burn more cleanly than
(25) gasoline, in part because they have
　　fewer, if and , carbon-carbon bonds,
　　and the hydrocarbons they do emit are
　　less likely to generate ozone. The
　　combustion of larger molecules, which
(30) have multiple carbon-carbon bonds,
　　involves a more complex series of
　　reactions. These reactions increase
　　the probability of incomplete com-
　　bustion and are more likely to release
(35) uncombusted and photochemically active
　　hydrocarbon compounds into the atmos-
　　phere. On the other hand, alternative
　　fuels do have drawbacks. Compressed
　　natural gas would require that vehicles
(40) have a set of heavy fuel tanks-a
　　serious liability in terms of perfor-
　　mance and fuel efficiency and liquefied
　　petroleum gas faces fundamental limits
　　on supply.
(45) 　Ethanol and methanol, on the other
　　hand, have important advantages over
　　other carbon-based alternative fuels;
　　they have a higher energy content
　　per volume and would require minimal
(50) changes in the existing network for
　　distributing motor fuel. Ethanol is
　　commonly used as a gasoline supplement,
　　but it is currently about twice as
　　expensive as methanol, the low cost
(55) of which is one of its attractive
　　features. Methanol's most attractive
　　feature,however,is that it can reduce
　　by about 90 percent the vehicle
　　emissions that form ozone, the most
(60) serious urban air pollutant.
　　　Like any alternative fuel,methanol
　　has its critics, Yet much of the
　　criticism is based on the use of
　　"gasoline clone" vehicles that do
(65) not incorporate even the simplest
　　design improvements that are made
　　possible with the use of methanol.
　　It is true, for example, that a
　　given volume of methanol provides
(70) only about one-half of the energy
　　that gasoline and diesel fuel do;
　　other things being equal, the fuel
　　tank would have to be somewhat larger
　　and heavier. However, since methanol-
(75) fueled vehicles could be designed to
　　be much more efficient than "gasoline
　　clone" vehicles fueled with methanol,
　　they would need comparatively less
　　fuel. Vehicles incorporating only the
(80) simplest of the engine improvements
　　that methanol makes feasible would
　　still contribute to an immediate
　　lessening of urban air pollution.

The author of the passage is primarily
concerned with
countering a flawed argument
that dismisses a possible solution
to a problem
reconciling contradictory points
of view about the nature of a problem
identifying the strengths of
possible solutions to a problem.
discussing a problem and arguing
in favor of one solution to it
outlining a plan of action to solve
a problem and discussing the obstacles
blocking that plan.

College librarian: Until three years ago, nonstudents
used the library without charge. Then, because of our
decreased budget, they were asked to pay $100 per year.
Nevertheless, about 150 nonstudents still use the library
without paying. We will therefore gain financially if we
hire a guard to identify nonstudents and ensure that they
have paid the fee.
　
Which of the following would it be most important to
know in order to evaluate the librarian's conclusion ?

The number of students who use the library annually.
The library's budget this year.
Whether the library has installed an expensive
　computerized cataloging system.
How much the library's budget was decreased three
　years ago.
The annual cost to the library of hiring a guard.

答案：(E)

The first people to inhabit North America came from
Asia. Scientists had hypothesized that these people
traveled across a now-submerged landmass that connected
the two continents until 14,000 years ago, depending for
food only on the land animals they hunted as they traveled.
Recent discoveries have led to the new hypothesis that the
first people came by boat along the southern shore of the
landmass, eating fish and sea mammals.
　
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the new hypothesis
by casting doubt on the earlier hypothesis?

The landmass connecting North America and Asia extended
　very far to the north.
In Europe, maritime cultures primarily dependent on the
　sea for food developed no earlier than 10,000 years ago.
People living in Asia at the time the two continents
　were connected hunted land animals for food.
The landmass was so bitterly cold that its vegetation
　would have been too sparse to support land animals.
Sophisticated and mature cultures that display great
　similarities to each other existed as far back as 8,000
　years ago in North America and Asia.

答案：(D)

A backpacker is choosing a route through a national park
that has six campsites―Quakerbridge, Rockside, Stonybrook,
Terraces, Underhill, and Vernon. The backpacker will spend
exactly four consecutive nights in the park, with one night
at Underhill and with one night each in three of the other
campsites. Any route is acceptable as long as it conforms
to the following conditions:
　
　If Quakerbridge is chosen, Rockside must also be chosen.
　Rockside and Terraces cannot both be chosen.
　Terraces cannot be chosen for the night that comes next
　　after the night spent at Underhill.
Which of the following is an acceptable sequence of
campsites, from first to last?
Quakerbridge, Rockside, Terraces, Underhill
Quakerbridge, Rockside, Vernon, Stonybrook
Quakerbridge, Rockside, Vernon, Underhill
Quakerbridge, Stonybrook, Terraces, Underhill
Stonybrook, Underhill, Terraces, Vernon

答案：(C)

If Quakerbridge is chosen, which of the following
campsites CANNOT be among those chosen?
Rockside
Stonybrook
Terraces
Underhill
Vernon

答案：(C)

If the third night is spent at Terraces, then the
second night must be spent at either
Quakerbridge or Vernon
Rockside or Stonybrook
Stonybrook or Vernon
Underhill or Stonybrook
Underhill or Vernon

答案：(C)

Of the following decisions, which will allow the
backpacker to choose a route from the largest number
of acceptable campsite sequences that include both
Terraces and Underhill?
The first night will be spent at Terraces.
The first night will be spent at Underhill.
The second night will be spent at Underhill.
The third night will be spent at Underhill.
The fourth night will be spent at Terraces.

答案：(A)

If the backpacker chooses Stonybrook, Terraces, and
Vernon, with the stays at Stonybrook and Vernon as many
nights apart as possible, which of the following must be true?
The first night is spent at Underhill.
The first night is spent at Vernon.
The second night is spent at Terraces.
The second night is spent at Underhill.
The fourth night is spent at Vernon.

答案：(C)

The parental choice program allows parents to choose
which public school in their school district their children
will attend. Districts that have adopted the program have
had a subsequent decline in the rate of high school dropouts.
The program, therefore, can improve the quality of public education.
　
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion drawn
above?

School administrators and teachers who know that
　students have the right to transfer else where will
　become more responsive to students educational needs.
The program is one of a number of proposals that
　do hot require increases in funds for education.
Some students dropped out of schools in districts
　that had the program.
The parental choice program would require parents
　to be responsible for the transportation of their children
　to and from any school other than the one closest to home.
Most school districts have provisions that make it
　relatively easy to transfer a teacher from one school
　in the district to another.

答案：(A)

Although the ratio of physicians to total population
is about the same in the United States and Canada, the
United States has 33 percent more surgeons per capita.
Clearly. this is the reason people in the United States
undergo 40 percent more operations per capita than do
Canadians.
　
The explanation given above rests on an assumption that

patients in the United States do not have a greater
　need for surgery than do patients in Canada.
the population of the United States is not larger
　than that of Canada.
United States patients sometimes travel to Canada
　for certain kinds of surgery
general practitioners in the United States do not
　as a rule examine a patient who is a candidate for surgery
　before sending the patient to a surgeon
there are no unnecessary surgical operations performed
　in Canada.

答案：(A)

问题：上面的解释所基于的假设是什么？
读题：尽管医生对总人口的比例在美国和加拿大是相同的，美国平均每人要多33%的外科
　　　医生。很明显，这是美国比加拿大平均每人要接受40%更多手术的原因。
　　
分析：很明显，第四行this is the reason说明前面是原因，后面是结论
　　
为什么美国人比加拿大人接受更多手术呢？
给出的解释是: 美国平均每人要多33%的外科医生
　　
原文用医生多解释了手术多。
此类Assumption形式一般为：
　1、没有其他的原因来解释上面这个事实。答案一般具有否定词
　2、直接假设，外科医生与手术之间的关系。
a. 美国的病人不比加拿大的病人有更多的外科手术的需求
　(去掉not, 美国的病人比加拿大的病人有更多的外科手术的需求, 表示有其他的原因，
　所以A就是ASSUMPTION)
　
b.　没有美国的人口不比加拿大多
　（文中谈的是人均）

A new ordinance passed by the Gorento Council a year
ago banned the sale of all nonrecyclable plastic packaging
for food being sold in Gorenton. A substantial percentage
of Gorenton's plastic waste, however, is still composed of
nonrecyclable plastic food packaging.
　
Which of the following, if true, best contributes to
reconciling the apparent discrepancy above?

Fewer food products are packaged in nonrecyclable
　plastics today than were so packaged a year ago.
The new ordinance affects only plastic food packaging
　and not other products packaged in plastic, many of which
　are sold in Gorenton.
Grocery and other stores in nearby suburban areas
　patronized by many Gorenton residents are unaffected by
　the new ordinance.
Many food products formerly packaged in nonrecyclable
　plastics are now specially packaged in recyclable plastic
　before being shipped so that they can be sold in Gorenton.
The total amount of both Gorenton's trash and its
　plastic waste grew considerably over the past year.

答案：(C)


One way for people to cut back on oil use is to switch
to other types of fuel.Because wood is a renewable resource
and can always be kept in constant supply, the use of wood
instead of oil for home heating would be one way to assure
the availability of energy resources in the future.
　
The argument above would be most seriously weakened if
which of the following were true?

In every country that uses wood for heating, wood is
　used to provide only part, not all of the heat for a home.
Every country that has ever used wood for heating has
　depleted its forests before the forests were able to
　regenerate themselves.
Every country that has used wood for home heating has
　done so only because it possessed a limited amount of other
　natural resources.
Many countries that use wood primarily for heating have
　a high incidence of fires that are due to improperly
　installed wood stoves.
In some countries the wood that would be used for home
　heating is owned by the government.

答案：(B)

问题：如果下面哪一个正确，上面的论述将被削弱？
读题：一个削减石油使用的方法是转向其他类型的能源。因为木材是一种可以更新的能源
　　　并且总是保持不断的供应，使用木材取代石油作为家用加热是保证将来能量资源获
　　　得的一种方法。
　
分析：文中第二行because引导原因，因为木材是可以更新的能源并且可以保持不断的供应
原因由because引导，反对一般为直接反对原因
　
a. 在每一个使用木材作为加热的国家，木材提供部分而不是全部的家用加热。
　（与原因无关，木材提供部分不能够说明什么，你并没有说石油是唯一的家用加热来源
　
b. 每个曾经使用木材作为加热的国家在木材能够再生之前，已经耗尽了森林。
　（直接反对原因，无法持续不断供应）

An architect designs a row of nine town houses, numbered
consecutively 1 through 9. The row will stand apart from
any other buildings. Each house will have exactly one of
five different kinds of siding―granite, plaster, shingle,
tile, or wood. In choosing sidings for the houses, the
architect always observes the following restrictions
　
　Each kind of siding must be used on at least one house
　　in the row.
　If a house has wood siding, it must be immediately
　　adjacent to at least one house with shingle siding.
　Neither a house with wood siding nor a house with
　　shingle siding can be immediately adjacent to a house
　　with tile siding.
　If a house has granite siding, it must be immediately
　　adjacent to at least one house with either tile siding
　　or plaster siding.
　Neither house 4 nor house 9 can have shingle siding.
Which of the following is an acceptable selection of
sidings for the first five houses in the row?
House 1 House 2 House 3 House 4 House5
Granite Plaster Shingle Wood Tile
Granite Shingle Wood Plaster Tile
Shingle Granite Wood Plaster Tile
Shingle Wood Plaster Granite Tile
Tile Granite Plaster Shingle Wood

For the United States meat industry, there is good
news and bad news. The bad news is that over the last
three years people in the United States have been eating
less meat. The good news, is that during this same time
period meat producers' profits have risen steadily.
　
Which of the following, if true during the last three
years, contributes most to a resolution of the apparent
discrepancy above?

People have been eating less meat because they are
　more health conscious than in the past.
In the United States many new restaurants that
　specialize in vegetarian meals have opened.
Competition from the growing fish industry has
　forced meat producers to sell meat at bargain prices
　in an attempt to attract more consumers.
Countries that are unable to produce enough meat for
　their populations have become a new and lucrative market
　for United States meat producers.
Meat producers have invested large amounts of money
　in advertising in order to win back consumers who have
　decreased their meet consumption.

答案：(D)

Simon: We still do not know whether machines might
　be able to think. Computers are able to perform very
　sophisticated tasks but lack the flexibility charac-
　teristic of human intelligence.
　
Roberta: We do not need more sophisticated computers
　to know whether machines can think, we humans are machines
　and we think.
　
Roberta's response to Simon is based on a reinter-
pretation of the term

"computer"
"know"
"machine"
"sophisticated"
"think"

答案：(C)

The dramatic rise in the number of homeless people
in the 1980's cannot be attributed to the discharge of
mentally ill persons from hospitals into community care,
even though it is true that provisions for such community
care are for the most part nonexistent.
　
Which of the following, if true, best supports the claim above?

The policy of discharging mentally ill persons from
　hospitals was based on the supposition that their illnesses
　could be controlled by newly developed drugs.
Without supervision in a hospital setting, those people
　whose mental illness can be controlled by medication might
　not actually take prescribed medication.
Some community care programs for mentally ill persons
　did exist in the 1980's. but those programs consisted
　primarily of outpatient clinics.
The policy of discharging significant numbers of
　mentally ill persons from hospitals took effect in the
　1960's.
There have always been some people in large cities
　who have led a homeless existence.

答案：(D)
