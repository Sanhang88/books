几个特殊句型
英文句型复杂多样，所幸的是TOEFL涉及到的基本是正常句型结构，但有时也会出现一些特殊句型。出现频率较高的有：（1）倒装句（Not unfit…）,(2)代词 it作形式主语或宾语，（3）代词It构成的强调句型。
倒装句常考题型解题要点
1. Not until…在句首要求主谓倒装
解题要点 Not until…倒装句主要集中在Structure(1-15题)中。当句首出现Not until短语，无需读完全句，而应迅速观看四个选择的第一个单词，寻找第一个单词为动词（通常为助动词did或had）或系动词的那个答案，再读完此答案以确认它是正确的倒装句结构，即动词＋主语名词＋其它。全真倒题分析。

(A) were known of the oldest paintings

(C) did“The Star-spangled Banner”become
(D) became “The Star-spangled Banner” (92.10)
(答案) C 谓语动词为实义动词（非系动词）时，通常使用助动词（did或had）并提前置主语的前面。故此句选择（C）而非（D） 。
（3）……was the first fully successful transatlantic cable finally laid.
(A) Not until 1866
(B) Until 1866, just
(C) Until 1866
