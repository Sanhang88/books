从属连词 
  复合句是TOEEL考题的基本句子结构，因而连接主句和从句的连接词就成为重要的命题焦点。TOEEL常考的从属连词分三类：（1）关系代词( that, which ,what who. Whose) (2) 关系副词（where when why how) (3) 状语从句连接词 (where, when, if, though, because…) 有关从属连词的试题大部分集中在Structure (1-15题中) 掌握命题规律，这类题目并不复杂。

(A) through it
(B) through which
(C) that is through
(D) there goes through (93.3)
[答案] B through which 指代through the circuit, 作用相当于一个关系副词，而介词through才能准确地表达句子的含义。

4. What 引导的名词性从句
解题要点：what兼先行词和关系代词双重身份，即what = the thing (things) that…。因此考生应特别注意，what既已包含先行词在内，它的前面就不应该再出现先行中心名词。What 与that 的区分是TOEEL常考题目
全真例题分析
(1) During the eighteenth century, Little Turtle was chief of the Miami tribe whose territory became ------- is now Indiana and Ohio.
(A) there
(B) where
(C) that
(D) what (93.5)
[答案] D what = the area that。What所指代的是地点、位置。然而，此句却不可选择（B）where。因为关系副词where不能作从句的主语。只有what即是先行词又是关系代词。
(2) The chief foods eaten in any country depend largely on ------- best in its climate and soil.
(A) it grows
(B) what grows
(C) does it grow
(D) what does grow (90.1)
[答案] B what grows = the thing that grows…另请注意：介词后面通常不能接that引导的从句，但可接what引导的名词性从句。
(3) A hinge joint is ------- permits the forward and backward movement of a door.
(A) the
(B) what
(C) those
(D) whose (88.10)
[答案] B what = the thing that…

(A) what it is conceived
(B) that is conceived
(C) what is conceived to be
(D) that is being conceived of (89.5)
[答案] C what = the thing that (is conceived to be…) .答案（A）中的代词it是多余的，因为what本身即已包含了先行词（the thing ) 和关系代词(that) 。答案（B）中的关系代词that引导的从句不可以置于介词的后面。
(5) Most of the food what elephants eat is brought to their mouths by their trunks. (93.10
[答案] B what应改为that。此句已含有先行词food，不能再用关系代词what。
5. 主句和从句
解题要点 主语从句是TOEEL常考而中国考生又较陌生英文文法结构。有关主语从句的命题几乎全部集中在structure (1-15题）中。主语从句的特点是读起来有种头重脚轻的感觉，而且有两个谓语动词。连词That 引导的主语从句应特别留意。因为That 在句中没有任何意义，它只具有引导出主语从句的功能，因而很容易被忽略。

(D)There is technological
[答案] B. That 引导的主语从句，当连续读到两个谓语动词(e.g. Helps…is)，而空格在句首，应首先考虑主语从句。这是主语从句典型的句子结构。
