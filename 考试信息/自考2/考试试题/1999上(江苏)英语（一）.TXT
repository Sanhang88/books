(1) if we get chilled； 
(2) if we get extra tired； 
(3) if we go outside with wet hair or with little clothes in cold weather； 
(4) if we are too close to a person with a colD．
    In other words， if we want to prevent catching cold， we should stay warm and dry； we should avoid getting too tired， and we should not be in close contact with people who have colds．

(1) Drink plenty of water． 
(2) Get extra rest． 
(3) Take a lot of vitamin C．
(4) Take aspirin．

Passage 2 
    Delicious food can play an important part in smoothing negotiation， and that must be a common experience of every man of affairs． Millions change hands in commercial transactions yearly as a result of a fine lunch or a fine dinner． "Will you lunch with me?" is a familiar phrase in the business world either in prefacing (开始；作为…开端) a successful deal or in celebrating one． No great event in history ever happened without its being previously． planned or determined at a feast． Men， after all， are human， whether they are princes or professors， clerks or customers． They must eat； and good cooking， agreeable to both the palate and the stomach， will put them not only in good temper but also in good humor， thus opening the way to a fruitful negotiation． Indeed， poor cooking has helped to change the course， of history． Napoleon felt so upset after eating badly cooked lamb that he made tactic errors which lost him the decisive battle of Leipzig．

Passage 3 
    'Travel' is the name of a modern disease which became rampant some years ago and is still spreading． The disease is carried by a germ called prosperity （成功；繁荣）． Its symptoms are easily recognizable． The patient grows restless in the early spring and starts rushing about from one travel agent to another collecting useless information about places he does not intend to visit． Then he or she will do a round of tailors， summer sales， and sports shops， spending three and a half times as much as he or she can afford； and finally， in August the patient will board a plane， train， coach or car and proceed to foreign parts along with thousands of fellow-sufferers， not because he is interested in or attracted by the place he is bound for， nor because he can afford to go， but simply because he cannot afford not to． The disease is highly infectious（传染的；有感染力的）and nowadays you catch Foreign Travel rather as you caught colds in the twenties， only more so!

七．将下面的短文译成汉语，并将译文写在答卷纸上的相应部分。（15％） 
    Thousands of years ago the ancient people found out that days were longer in summer than in winter， and nights were shorter． They knew that this had a great deal to do with the changes of the seasons and the growth of plants and animals． Now we know that all this is caused by the movement of the earth around the sun． As the earth journeys around the sun，it spins（旋转） on its own axis （轴）． This can be explained by a simple experiment． If you push a sharp stick through a rubber ball and twirl（旋转） it with two fingers， the ball spins around in much the same way the earth is spinning at this very moment． If you twirl this ball at night directly in front of a bright light，you will notice that half the ball is lighted up while the other half is in the shade． That is just like our night and day．
