Ⅲ.Reading Comprehension(30 points, 2 points for each item)
从下列每篇短文的问题后所给的四个选择项中选出一个最佳答案，并将选项号填在答题纸的相应位置上。
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
    "No man is an island," wrote the poet John Donne several centuries ago. He was acknowledging one of our most distinctive characteristics: the fact that we are social animals whose behavior and personalities are shaped by the groups to which we belong.
    Throughout life, most of our daily activities are performed in the company of others. Whether our purpose is working, playing, raising a family, learning, or simply relaxing, we usually pursue it in groups, even if the group is as small as two or three people. Out need for human contacts is not merely a practical one; it is a deep psychological need as well. If people are deprived of the company of others for prolonged periods, mental breakdown is the usual result. Even the Geneva Convention(日内瓦公约)，an international agreement that regulates the treatment of prisoners of war, recognizes this need. It regards solitary(孤独的) imprisonment for more than thirty day as a cruel form of torture(折磨).
    In its strictest sense, a group is a collection of people interacting together in an orderly way on the basis of shared expectations about one another's behavior. As result of this interaction, members feel a common sense of "belonging." They distinguish members from nonmembers and expect certain kinds of behavior from outsiders.
21.By "No man is an island," John Donne means _____.
A.no one can live on an island alone
B.a man is not surrounded by sea on all sides
C.a man and an island are irrelevant
D.no one can live in isolation from other people
22.The fact that we work or even play in groups illustrates the point that ____.
A.poeple are different from animals
B.Donne recognized the group to which he belonged
C.human beings are social animals
D.human behavior and personalities are formed by others
23."Breakdown" as used in Line 6, Paragraph 2 most probably denotes ____.
A.separation
B.collapse
C.analysis
D.function
24.According to the passage, what is NOT a characteristic of group?
A.There are at least two people in it.
B.The members share some common grounds.
C.The members work for one purpose.
D.The members interact regularly with each other.
25.This passage is mainly about _______.
A.the importance of human contacts
B.pattens of human behavior
C.the importance of human activities
D.patterns of human society
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
    The word health can be used in a number of ways. In the past, health only the absence of disease or illness. Today, though, health has a broader meaning. Health is the state of your well-being that includes how you feel physically, mentally, and socially. Wellness is another term that describes this broader view of health. You can understand the need for a broader definition if you think about how health in your life is different from health in your grandparents' lives.
    In 1900, the main causes of death were diseases that were spread by bacteria(细菌) and viruses(病毒).If you had lived then, the danger of your dying from pneumonia(肺炎) would have been three times greater than the danger of your dying from cancer.
    The diseases that were most common in 1900 affected people of all ages. It is not surprising, then that around 1900, the emphasis of health was on freedom from illness. Today many of the diseases that were common in 1900 can be prevented or cured by improved medicines and methods of sanitation(卫生). Most diseases now are likely to occur later in life. You as a teenager will probably not have to think about the same threats to your health as your grandparents did.
    These improvements in health conditions mean that not only can you now enjoy a better life, but you also have a greater chance of having a longer life. Conrtolling diseases has increased the life expectancy in the United States. Grenerally, people born more recently have higher life expectancies. Since 1900, the life expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 27 years. It has increased from 47 years for those born in 1900 to 74 years 1981.
26.According to Paragraph 1, health and wellness ______.
A.can be used interchangeably on all occasions
B.are different in that the latter has a broader sense
C.had the same meaning in the past
D.both refer to the state of your well-being
27.Which of the following statements is true?
A.Diseases caused by bacteria and viruses were incurable in 1900.
B.Bacteria and viruses are the main causes of death today.
C.Medicines for curing pneumonia were not available in 1900.
D.Pneumonia caused as many deaths in 1900 as cancer does today.
28."Life expectancy" in the last paragraph most probably means ____.
A.the kind of life that a person may expect to live
B.the mode of life that a group of people have lived
C.the length of time that a person or an animal has lived
D.the length of time that people may expect to live
29.On an average, people in America who were born in 1900 ______.
A.had a life-span of 74 years
B.lived a shorter but better life than those born later
C.lived to 47 years of age
D.lived 27 years longer than those born in 1981
30.The intended readers of the passage are _______.
A.teenagers
B.the diseased
C.adults
D.aged people
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
    Most Americans would have a difficult time telling you, specifically, what the values are which Americans live by. They have never given the matter any thought.
    Over the years I have introduced thousands of international visitors to life in the United States. This has caused me to try to lock at Americans through the eyes of foreign visitors, I am confident that the values listed in this booklet describe most (but not all )Americans, and that understanding these values can help you, the international visitor, understand Americans.
    It is my belief that if foreign visitors really understand how deeply these 13 values are ingrained in Americans, they will then be able to understand 95% of American actions -actions which might otherwise appear "strange,""confusing,"or "unbelievable" when evaluated from the perspective of the foreigner's own society and its values.
    The different behaviors of a people or a culture make sense only when seen through the basic beliefs, assumptions and values of that particular group. When you encounter and action, or hear a statement in the United States which surprises you, try to see it as an expression of one or more of the values listed in this booklet.
31.Can an ordinary American tell you his/her value system?
A.Yes, because this is something an American lives by.
B.No, because everyone will have his/her own system.
C.No, because he/she has never thought about it.
D.Yes, because values are something often in their thought.
32.The author lists 13 values in his booklet to _____.
A.invite foreigners to visit America
B.look at Americans through the eyes of foreign visitors
C.describe the confusing actions of most Americans
D.help international visitors understand Americans
33.The word "ingrained" in Line 2, Paragraph 3 most probably means _____.
A.rooted in the minds
B.found in the grains
C.planted for food
D.prepared with grain

A.Americans are hard to understand
B.Americans have values which are entirely different from their own
C.they view Americans according to the values in their own society
D.it is difficult to understand any people when you first encounter them

Ⅶ.Translation from English into Chinese(15 points)
将下列短文译成汉语并将答案写在答题纸上。
    When we talk about intelligence, we do not mean the ability to get good scores on certain kinds of tests or the ability to do well in school. By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or upsetting situation.
    For instance, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then predicts the situation, acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And if he cannot make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he has failed; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook on life, a special feeling about life, and knows how to fit into it.

Ⅶ.Translation from English into Chinese(15 points)
谈到聪明，我们不是指在某些种类的考试中得高分、或者在学校取得优异成绩的能力。我们所指的聪明是一种生活和行为的方式，尤其是在新的或者令人不安的情况下的生活行为方式。
比如，遇到新的情况，聪明人考虑的不是自己，或者自己会出什么事，而是尽一切努力了解情况，然后预测形势，并立即采取行动解决问题。他或许并不知道行动的结局如何，但至少他会尽力而为。如果他无法解决好问题，他不会因为失败而感到难堪，他只会从错误中取教训。聪明人即使年龄很小也对生活有特殊的态度、特殊的情感，并知道如何适应生活。
