Passage 1
  Never use any drug unless there is a good reason, especially in a woman who is expecting a baby. Ask the patient if he has had previous drug reactions: if he has, be cautious(小心). It is estimated that more than half of the adverse reactions that are reported would be presented if this were done.
  Ask the patient if he is already receiving other drugs.
  If possible, use a drug with which you are familiar. If you use a  new drug, be specially on the watch for adverse reactions.
  Report serious or unusual reactions suspected as due to established drugs, and any reaction however trivial(轻微) that may be due to a newly marketed drug.
1) This is a set of recommendations for __________.
A. drug company representatives
B. doctors prescribing for patients
C. scientists who specialize in drugs
D. doctors treating drug takers
2) The patients should be asked if they are __________.
A. familiar with drugs

D. full reports should be made of all the effects of all drugs
Passage 2
  Researchers have shown that noise can adversely affect humans in both physiological and psychological ways. Hearing losses in particular occupations such as ship-building and construction work are well known. In fact, however, we all find hearing more difficult as we age. Young ears can distinguish a wide range of sounds from low to very high frequencies, while older ears lose the ability to distinguish high-pitched sounds(高音). A comparison of people living in some industrialized and non-industrialized areas suggests that this hearing loss may not necessarily accompany old age.
  Furthermore, a closer inspection of other data reveals economic effects. For instance, an increased turnover(周转，易手) in property has been observed in noisy areas near airports. Job performance can be adversely affected by loud noise, especially if accuracy and mental effort are involved. The use of outdoor(户外的) areas for conversation is not possible for an estimated 5 to 10 million people who live or work in urban area. When interference with television or speech or sleep is included, as many as 22 to 24 million people can be said to have lost part of the use of their homes and grounds because of noise.
  Thus noise pollution is a serious environmental concern. The indifferent attitude toward noise should be overcome; considerable efforts should be made to alert people to the grave effects which may stem from an excessively noisy environment.
4) We can learn from this passage that __________.
A. young people are able to distinguish high-pitched sounds
B. Young people distinguish low frequency noise better than old people
C. high frequency noise can cause hearing loss in old people
D. industrialized people will suffer hearing loss when they are old
5) According to the text, noise can interfere with sleep. Which of the following statements does this imply? __________
A. Noise can cause dreams.
B. Noise makes people turn round in their sleep.
C. Noise makes people sleep more.
D. Noise interrupts sleep.
6) The grave effects of noise on humans are __________.
A. physiological only
B. psychological only
C. psychological, physiological and economic
D. both psychological and physiological
Passage 3
  Everything that is new or uncommon raises a pleasure in the imagination, and because it fills the soul with a pleasant surprise, satisfies its curiosity, and gives it an idea which it did not possess before. We are too much familiar with one set of objects and tired out with so many repeated shows of the same things and whatever is new or uncommon contributes a little to vary human life with the strangeness of its appearance: it serves us for a kind of refreshment, and takes off that satiety(厌腻) we tend to complain of in our usual and ordinary entertainments. It is this variety that gives our mind something new and relieves our attention from dwelling(滞留) too long and wasting itself on any particular object. It is this, likewise, that improves what is great or beautiful, and makes it afford our mind an double entertainment. Woods, fields, and meadows are at any season of the year pleasant to look upon but never so much as in the beginning of the spring, when they are all new and fresh and not yet too much accustomed and familiar to the eye. For this reason there is nothing that makes a prospect more fascinating than rivers or sprays of water from fountains, where the scene is constantly shifting and entertaining the sight every moment with something new. We are quickly tired with looking upon hills and valleys, where everything remains fixed and settled in the same place and manner, but find our thoughts a little excited and relieved at the sight of such objects as are ever in motion and sliding away from beneath our eyes.
7) Which of the following contains the main idea of the passage? ________
A. Whatever is new is more worthwhile than that which is old.
B. Newness makes a thing fascinating.
C. We must change the old for the new to achieve variety.
D. We cannot evaluate the worth of an item until it is no longer new.
8) Which of the following describes the development of the ideas in this passage? ________
A. The thought moves by association from one aspect to another.
B. The thought moves from a hypothesis to an application of the hypothesis.
C. The thought moves from a generalization to a series of observations to prove the generalization.
D. The thought moves from event to event in the time sequence.
9) The author's implied purpose in this passage is to ________.
A. entertain the reader
B. prevent the reader from making mistakes
C. present an alternative view
D. improve the reader's sense of right and wrong
10) The author finds fountains fascinating because ________.
A. of the beauty of their appearance
B. of the freshness of the water
C. of the movement of the water
D. of the beauty of nature
6. 完形填空
  In English -- as in any other language -- we do not always say what we mean or mean what we say. This is true     1    some of the things we say every day. For example: "How do you do?" "How are you?" This is what people say     2    meeting. Sometimes they stop and shake hands. "How are you?" looks like a question. It     3    written with a question mark after it.     4    sometimes "How are you?" is a question. One person may want to know     5    another is well or ill -- how his health is -- and son on.
  When there are question they are almost said     6    the person who says them means them     7    questions and wants an answer. But most     8    they are said in a way which does not ask for any answer. When these words are said     9    , we do not answer: "I am tired," or "I have a bad cold," or "I am not well." We say the same thing back to     10    person: "How are you?" or "Hello!" Such words are like a smile or a wave of the hand.
1) A. to    B. of    C. with    D. for
2) A. in    B. at    C. during    D. on
3) A. is being    B. is    C. will be    D. has been
4) A. Moreover    B. And    C. Hence    D. Consequently
5) A. why    B. how    C. if    D. when
6) A. when    B. but    C. after    D. as if
7) A. like    B. through    C. as    D. by
8) A. of the time    B. of the times    C. time    D. times
9) A. so    B. such    C. this    D. thus
10) A. another    B. the other    C. every other    D. other
7. 将下面的短文译成汉语。
Gestures
  A gesture is any body action that conveys a message to an observer. The body action may be accompanied by a spoken message or it may occur alone. The important thing is that it communicates the thoughts or feelings of one person to another looking on. People consciously use many different kinds of gestures to communicate with each other. They smile or nod, and they shake hands to convey feelings of pleasure at meeting someone. Often, however, people are unaware of how much information their unconscious body actions communicate about them. These gestures may reveal their thoughts and feelings ever when they don't mean to communicate them. For example, people sometimes yawn(打呵欠), when they are bored and anxious to leave. Some gestures, like smiling, seem to be a part of human nature. They are common to all cultures. Other gestures, like saluting, are learned, and they vary from situation to situation.
8. 将下面的句子译成英语。

答案及分析：
1. 单词汉译英
1)physics   2)produce   3)equal   4)guard   5)otherwise 6)journey   7)organ   8)confuse   9)grogram   10)average 11)invent   12)gift   13)improve   14)method   15)prepare 16)signal   17)similar   18)garage   19)introduce   20)gang
2. 填写语法形式
1) saw
一般过去式，因为这个动作是在过去某个时候（1994年）发生的。
2) getting
动名词。busy (in) doing sth. 是一个固定句式，表示正忙于做某事。
3) to be asked
动词不定式的被动形式。它的逻辑主语 I 是这个不定式所表示的动作的承受者，故要求用被动形式。
4) is translated
一般现在式被动语态，主语 it （即 the nove ）是动作的承受着。
5) Reading
它和 aloud 一起构成动名词短语做主语。动名词和不定式都可作主语，如果我们讲的是笼统的、非特指的情况，一般用动名词。
6) meeting
动名词。某些动词的后面只能跟动名词作它的宾语，avoid 即其中之一。
7) farther
形容词 far 的比较级。句型"the + 比较级…， the + 比较级"是"越……，就越……"的意思。
8) (should) rain
在由连词 lest 引起的状语从句中，谓语动词常要求带 should，或直接用动词原形。
9) has been reached
现在完成式被动语态。句中的时间状语 so far 决定了谓语动词要用完成式。一般说来，句子中含有包括现在时间的时间状语时，谓语动词往往用现在完成式。
10) had taken
这是一个表示过去情况的虚拟条件句。在这样的句子中，从句的谓语动词要求用过去完成式，主句的谓语动词要求用 would + 完成式。
3. 结构及文字表达
1）C
Try as you may（不管你怎样努力）是一个让步状语从句。由as引出的这种从句要求用倒装语序。"动词原形 + as + 主语 + may，might等"是其中的一种形式。不选A，though 偶尔也可这样用，但不多见。
2）A
if only 用来表示一种愿望，意义上相当于wish。它和only if 不同，后者引起一个条件状语从句，一般不能单独成句。
3）B
weather permitting 是分词独立结构，表示条件，相当于 if wheather permits。不要选A，没有连词它不能成为句子的一个成分。
4）A
本句为强调句型，强调的是时间状语last night，其后应该用连词that。
5）B
本句that引出的是一个同位语从句，指news 的具体内容。不能选C，因为这里不是定语从句。
6）C
名词guess后要求用at 表示猜测的对象。
7）C
动词convict 后要求用of 表示指控的内容。
8）A
in the midst of "在……之中"，意思与among相似。不能选B， in the middle of(在……中间)通常表示位置。
9）D
make sense of的意思是"理解，弄懂……的意思"。其余几个词不能用于这一结构。
10）A
set aside是固定结构，此处意为"留出（时间）"。其余几个词和set 不能构成这个意思。
4. 错误识别
1）D
应是 put up with （容忍）。put up意为"举起，提出"等，与上下文的意思不符。
2）A
不应该有if。 suppose（或 supposing）本身可引起一个条件状语从句。
3）D
应是 articles。 article是可数名词，说道"各种用品"要用复数。
4）C
应是 a certain amount。名词amount 用来表示数量的多少时前面要加不定冠词。
5）A
应是was。此处be 的时态应同时间状语 at the turn of the seventeenth century and also at the beginning of the twentieth century 相呼应。
5. 阅读理解题
1）B
文中几次提到ask the patient…，还提到要注意药物可能引起的不良反应，对孕妇用药要特别小心等。可知是在告诫医生开处方时要谨慎。不要选D， drug takers 是指吸毒者，不是一般病人。
2）C
见第2段。本文在另一处也提醒要 ask the patient，但询问的内容是以前有没有过药物反应，选择项中没有列入。
3）A
见最后一段的最后一部分： …any reaction however trivial that may be due to a newly marketed drug。不要选D，文中只提到： Report serious or unusual reactions suspected as due to established drugs，也就是说对现有的药物，要报告的只限于严重的、不寻常的反应。
4）D
本文第1段提到…we all find hearing more difficult as we age，意思是说：人们发现随着年龄的增长，自己的听力会逐渐衰退。这一段的最后一句说，比较生活在工业发达地区和工业不发达地区的人，发现听力衰退不一定和年龄的增长有关。它暗示，只有住在工业区的人们听力才会逐渐受到损害。不要选C，这一选项的意思是：高频噪声对老年人的听力有损害。从全段的意思看，这是不对的。老年人所以听力衰退，是长期（从年轻时起）受噪音污染的结果。
5）D
句中 interfere with sleep（干扰睡眠）和 interrupt sleep 的意思相同。
6）C
文中第1段首先提到噪音在生理和心理两方面对人有不利的影响，第2段第1句又说别的数据资料揭示在经济上也有影响。可知这种影响是三方面的。
7）B
本文第1句提出了作者的观点，那就是新的、不寻常的事物能给人以愉悦、激发人们的想象力等等，这也是本文的主导思想。选项B是说新鲜感赋予事物以吸引力，正是这个意思。不要选A，这一选项说凡是新事物都比旧事物有价值，本文不涉及价值问题。
8）C
本文先提出作者的总观点，然后举例证明自己的观点。这种叙述方式正是C项所指的那一种。
9）C
作者在文中例举的现象可能有各种解释，作者提出了自己的见解，让读者自己作出判断，哪一种解释最合理。这就是作者的目的，他没有说别的什么解释是错误的。
10）C
作者在提到没有什么东西比河流或喷泉的景象更动人时说 where the scene is constantly shifting and entertaining the sight every moment with something new。这里的shifting就是指水的流动。
6.完形填空
1）B   2)B   3)B   4)C   5)C   6)A   7)C   8)A   9)A   10)B
7.英译汉
示意动作
示意动作是指向能看到的人传达信息的任何身体动作。身体动作可以伴有语言，也可以是单独的行为。它的重要之处在于它能向对方传达一个人的思想感情。人们有意识地运用多种不同的示意动作相互交流。人们在遇到某人时往往微微一笑或点点头，再就是握握手以表达愉快的心情。然而人们并不是总能觉察到他们自己的一些未意识到的身体动作是在表达自己的见解。这些示意动作甚至在他们并不打算表达时就暴露了他们的思想感情。例如，人们在感觉厌倦而急于想离去时往往会打呵欠。像微笑一类的示意动作看来是人类的天性，为不同文化的各民族所共有。其他一些示意动作如打招呼致意，则是学来的，这种动作随情况不同而各异。
8. 汉译英
1) In United States, some states have a sales tax in addition to an income tax.
2) A nuclear family usually consists of father, mother and their children.
3) The left part of human brain has strong effect on a person's ability of using words.
4) The change took place so fast that none of us saw it clearly.
5) The main purpose of this article is to tell you how to schedule your time.
