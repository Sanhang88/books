Ⅲ. Reading Comprehension (30 points,2 points for each item)
从下列每篇短文后面的问题所给的四个选择项中选出一个最佳答案，并在答题卡上将相应的字母涂黑。 
Passage One
Questions 20 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the past industries had more freedom than they have now, and they did not need to be as careful as they must today. They did not need to worry a lot about the safety of the new products that they developed. They did not have to pay much attention to the health and safety of the people who worked for them. Often new products were dangerous for the people who used them; often conditions in the work place had very bad effects on the health of the workers.
Of course sometimes there were real disasters which attracted the attention of government and which showed need for changes. Also scientists who were doing research into the health of workers sometimes produced information which governments could not ignore. At such times, there were inquiries into the causes of the disaster or the problems. New safety rules were often introduced as a result of these inquiries; however, the new rules came too late to protect the people who had died or become seriously ill.
Today many governments have special departments which protect customers and workers. In the U.S., for example, there is a department which tests new airplanes and gives warnings about possible problems. It also makes the rules that aircraft producers must follow. Another department controls the foods and drugs that companies sell. A third department looks at the places where people work, and then reports any companies that are breaking laws which protect the health and safety of workers.
21. According to Paragraph 1, compared with today, industries in the past _______.
[A] were controlled less strictly
[B] were worse off
[C] affected more people's health
[D] put out more unhealthy products
22. It is implied in Paragraph 2 that years ago governments _________.
[A] paid much attention to the results of scientific discoveries
[B] seldom introduced safety laws before disasters occurred
[C] hardly ever looked into the causes of tragedies
[D] imposed safety rules as soon as disasters occurred
23. In the U.S. today ________.
[A] there are altogether three departments which protect customers and workers
[B] stores dealing in foods and drugs are under government control
[C] a company with poor or dangerous working conditions is likely to be punished
[D] the protection of workers' health and safety is well ensured
24. The main topic of the passage is _________.
[A] industries in the past and at present
[B] changes in the development of industries
[C] the protection of industrial workers and customers
[D] the freedom of industries
25. The purpose of this passage is to __________.
[A] inform
[B] criticize
[C] entertain
[D] persuade
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
    I made a pledge to myself on the way down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. Totally loving. No ifs, ands or buts.
    The idea had come to me as I listened to a talk on my car radio. The speaker was quoting a Biblical(圣经的)passage about husbands being thoughtful of their wives. Then he went on to say,"Love is an act of will. A person can choose to love." To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change.
    And it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said,"That new yellow sweater(套头衫) looks great on you."
    "Oh, Tom, you noticed,"she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little puzzled.
    After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought,"Evelyn's been alone here with the kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me."We walked on the beach while the children flew their kites.
    So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street firm where I am a director; a visit to the shell museum though I usually hate museums. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new pledge to keep on remembering to choose love.
    There was one thing that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn stared at me with the saddest expression.
    "What's the matter?"I asked her.
    "Tom,"she said in a voice filled with distress,"do you know something I don't?"
    "What do you mean?"
    "Well…that checkup(体检) I had several weeks ago…our doctor…did he tell you something about me？Tom, you've been so good to me…am I dying?"
    It took a moment for it all to sink in. Then I burst out laughing.
    "No, honey,"I said, wrapping her in my arms."You're not dying; I'm just starting to live."
26. In the first paragraph,"No ifs, ands or buts"probably means"_________."
[A] Unintentionally
[B] Inevitably
[C] Impressively
[D] Unconditionally
27. From the story we may infer that Tom drove to the beach cottage ________.
[A] with his family
[B] with Evelyn
[C] alone
[D] with his children
28. During the two weeks on the beach, Tom showed more love to his wife because _________.
[A] she looked lovely in her new clothes
[B] he had made a lot of money in his Wall Street firm
[C] he was determined to be a good husband
[D] she was seriously ill
29. The author says,"There was one thing that went wrong with my experiment."What was the one thing that went wrong?
[A] He praised her sweater, which puzzled her.
[B] She insisted on visiting a museum, which he hated.
[C] He knew something about her illness but didn't tell her.
[D] He was so good to her that she thought she must be dying.
30. By saying"I'm just starting to live,"Tom means that ________.
[A] he is just beginning to understand the real meaning of life
[B] he is just beginning to enjoy life as a loving husband
[C] he lived an unhappy life before and is now starting to change
[D] he is beginning to feel regret for what he did to his wife before
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
    Americans who remember"the good old days"are not alone in complaining about the educational system in this country. Immigrants(移民)complain, too. Lately a German friend was filled with anger when he learned that the mathematics test given to his son on his first day as a college freshman included multiplication and division. Japanese businessmen in Los Angeles send their children to private schools staffed by teachers imported from Japan to learn mathematics at Japanese levels, generally considered at least a year more advanced than the level here.
    But I wonder: If American education is so poor, why is it that this is still the country of innovation(创新)?
    When I was 12 in Indonesia, I had to memorize the name of all the world's major cities, from Kabul to Karachi. At the same age, my son, who was brought up a Californian, thought that Buenos Aires was Spanish for good food. However, unlike children of his age in Asia and Europe, my son had studied creative geography. When he was only 6, he drew a map of the route that he traveled to get to school, including the streets, the traffic signs and the houses that he passed.
    Dissatisfied American parents forget that in this country their children are able to experiment freely with ideas; without this they will not really be able to think or to believe in themselves.
    Critics of American education cannot grasp one thing: freedom. America, I think, is the only country that extends even to children the license to freely speak, write and be creative. Our public education certainly is not perfect, but it is a great deal better than any other. I think I have found the answer to my question.
31. From the text we learn that _________.
[A] both Americans and immigrants are dissatisfied with the quality of American education
[B] the author shares the general idea that American education is worse than education in many other countries
[C] Japanese schools in America require their American teachers to teach mathematics at Japanese levels
[D] the author's German friend was a little displeased because the mathematics test for his son was too easy
32. Which of the following is NOT true?
[A] The author most probably was an immigrant from Asia and received some school education there.
[B] Buenos Aires must be the name of a city, as are Kabul and Karachi.
[C] Children in other countries are not likely to learn creative geography.
[D] The knowledge of geography of the author's son shows that American education is poor.
33. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
[A] If children are not allowed to experiment freely with ideas they won't grow up independent and creative.
[B] Most Americans think the present American educational system is not as good as it used to be
[C] Private schools run by Japanese businessmen maintain a higher level than American public schools.
[D] Americans are more innovative than other people in the world.
34. In the last paragraph the author says,"I have found the answer to my question." What is the question?
[A] Is Japanese education better than American education?
[B] Why do Japanese businessmen send their children to Japanese-staffed schools?
[C] Why was my son not taught enough geographic knowledge?
[D] Is American education really worse than education in other countries?
35. What would be the best title for this passage?
[A] American education and education in foreign countries
[B] Improvement needed for American education
[C] Freedom to think-characteristic of American education
[D] Education and innovation in America

    It is amazing(令人惊讶的)how much we know about parenting before we have children, and how little we know once we become parents ourselves. Before we have children we know just how to avoid making the mistakes our parents made and how to handle those violent tempers that we see other parents mismanage.
    And then we have our own children. What happens to all that confidence and knowledge? If we're lucky, we can hold on to it briefly as our hearts are filled with wonder at that lovely baby who can do no wrong. But in no time at all that newborn baby who brought us so much joy is challenging us in ways we never imagined and bringing confusion into our once orderly lives.
