Passage 3
Poverty and Health
    Peciatrician,Dr．Tony Walterston has growing evidence that the health deficit between those in Social Class Five ,that is the lowest rung on the socioeconomic ladder, and those who are better off,begins in childhood．
    "In mortality ,the gibbest effect is in child accidents．There are five-fold accidents between Social Class Five and Social Class One,particularly in road accidents.
    And this is almostcertaibnly due to the lack of safe play areas,in deprived areas．So basically children play on the streets．In the homes,it is related to home safety and the lack，in poor housing,poor quality housing，of safety measures．So there are no smoke alarms，so the fires are more common，and there is lack of protection on stairs and on windows，so that children have accidents much more commonly．This is a very major diffference."
    "Fivefold difference is a very major difference．"
    "Quit,quite．It is also in terms of morbidity,which means the diseases．children get and them die．All infections are much greater in Social Class Five．In pneumonia, whooping cough,ear infections,and ear ifecton,In particular,has an impact in education, because children have hearing loss．And these are probably due to damp and over-crowing, so that children are brought more closer together and infections happen more easily."
    "More than one in three children are now growing up in relative poverty．Twenty years ago it was one in ten．And family's income is less than half the national average wage."
    Dr．Iona Heath,who works in an inner city practice in London,sees the impact on her patients of low income, compounded by poor employment prospects,poor housing and poor diet．
    "It generates a chronic stress that seems to undermine physical and mental healty."
    "Can you see it literally in people has they come into surgery？I mean,they just don't look well?"
    "You can see that people look tired,and stressed,and defeated,and feel on sense of place in society that's apparentoy doing well.I think that's the argument about relative poverty.It's that there's a lot of rhetoric about how well people are doing．You see a lot of wonderful,glossy advertisements about how life could be and yet it's million miles away from the life that you have． And you begin to feel a bit overwhemed by it,because the number of times that I have to prescribe anti-depression medication for people who have become clinically depressed．But they and I know that what they need is a move of housing,and more appropriate housing,more space．Popple,you know,families a four,living in two rooms with teenage children,it's unacceptable．"
    The othere side of the coin is that the socially advantaged are living longer, healthier lives than ever before．
