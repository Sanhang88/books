    Chinese audiences will see scenes of horror in a remarkable new film called Schindler's Lust. In the movie, the terror of the Nazi conquest of Poland, and the murder of Europe's Jews is captured in frightening detail.

Spielberg said, "He was in the Oskar Schindler business for a lot of his career, but something happened along the road that changed him." Schindler saved the lives of more than a thousand Jews, by negotiating with their Nazi captors. His heroism put Schindler's own life in great danger. Schindler himself eventually died after an unsuccessful attempt at farming in South America, but not before the state of Israel honored him for his bravery.

Passage 3 
Poverty and Health 
    Pediatrician, Dr. Tony Walterston has growing evidence that the health deficit between those in Social Class Five, that is the lowest rung on the socioeconomic ladder, and those who are better off, begins in childhood. 
    "In mortality, the biggest effect is in child accidents. There are five-fold accidents. And this is almost certainly due to the lack of safe play areas, in deprived areas. So basically children play on the streets. In the homes, it is related to home safety and the lack, in poor housing, poor quality housing, of safety measures. So there are no smoke alarms, so the fires are more common, and there is lack of protection on stairs and on stairs and on windows, so that children have accidents much more commonly. This is a very major difference." 
    "Fivefold difference is a very major difference." 
    "Quite, quite. It is also in terms of morbidity, Which means the diseases children get and then die. All infections are much greater in Social Class Five. In pneumonia, whooping cough, ear infections, and ear infection, in particular, has an impact in education, because children have hearing loss. And these are probably due to damp and over-crowding, so that children are brought more closer together and infections happen more easily." 
    "More than one in three children are now growing up in relative poverty. Twenty years ago it was one in ten. And family's income is less than half the national average wage." 
    Dr. Iona Heath, who works in an inner city practice in London, sees the impact on her patients of low income, compounded by poor employment prospects, poor housing and poor diet. 
    "It generates a chronic stress that seems to undermine physical and mental health." 
    "Can you see it literally in people as they come into surgery? I mean, they just don't look well?" 
    "You can see that people look tired, and stressed, and defeated, and feel no sense of place in society that's apparently doing well. I think that's the argument about relative poverty. It's that there's a lot of rhetoric about how well people are doing. You see a lot of wonderful, glossy advertisements about how life could be and yet it's million miles away from the life that you have. And you begin to feel a bit overwhelmed by it, because the number of times that I have to prescribe anti-depression medication for people who have become clinically depressed. But they and I know that what they need is a move of housing, and more appropriate housing, more space. People, you know, families of four, living in two rooms with teenage children, it's unacceptable." 
    The other side of the coin is that the socially advantaged are living longer, healthier lives than ever before. 
1.The relation between poverty and health ________. 
A.is only felt by doctors 
B.does exist 
C.is a myth 
D.has not been studied yet 
2.Accidents happen ________. 
A.among children from both poor and rich families alike 
B.among children from poor families far more often 
C.among adults more than children 
D.among starving children only 
3.According to Dr Heath, the influence of poverty upon her patients are ________. 
A.both physical and mental 
B.more physical than mental 
C.only physical 
D.more mental than physical 
4.The impression we gather from this passage is that ________. 
A.the number of poor people is decreasing 
B.the number of poor people is going up 
C.the entire population has increased 
D.the entire population has decreased 
Ⅵ．完形填空，并将所选答案之字母填入答题纸上相应的空格。（10%）
    When we work and also when we play we use up energy. The energy may be physical or mental or a combination of the two. If we 1 someone at a job and keep him at it continuously without rest, ultimately he will break 2 and be unable to go on. If, however, he can stop for 3 or do something else for a change, he will be able to work for a longer period of time. Efficiency, then, seems to be in a large 4 a matter of the distribution(分布) of work and rest periods. In ordinary life work and rest usually take place by 5 . We work during the day, and sleep at night. We continue to alternate between work and rest, 6 . 
    Suppose now we consider a single period of work. We notice first that the worker is less efficient at the 7 beginning than he is after working a short time. This phenomenon, 8 "warming up," is found in many different activities. Some activities need a long warming up period 9 others need a short period. The speed 10 which the point of highest efficiency is reached varies from individual to individual.
