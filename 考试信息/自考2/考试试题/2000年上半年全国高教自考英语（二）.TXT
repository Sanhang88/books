Ⅲ.Reading Comprehension（30 points,2 pints for each） 
从下列每篇短文的问题后所给的四个选择项中选出一个最佳答案，并在答案纸上将相应的字母涂黑。 
Passage One 
Question21 to25 are based on the following passage. 
    Art, said Picasso, is a lie that makes us realize the truth. So is a map. We do not usually associate the precise work of the map maker with a fanciful object of art. Yet a map has many qualities that a painting or a poem has. It is truth realized in a symbolic way, holding meanings it does not express on the surface. And like work of art, it requires imaginative reading. 
    Thus, map and reality are not, and cannot be, identical. No aspect of map use is so obvious yet so often overlooked. Most map reading mistakes occur because the user forgets this vital fact and expects a one-to-one correspondence between map and reality. A map, like a painting, is just one special version of reality. To understand a painting, you must have some idea of the medium which was used by the artist. You wouldn't expect a water color to look anything like an oil painting or a charcoal（木碳）drawing, even if the subject matter of all three were identical. In the same way, the techniques used to create maps will greatly influence the final representation. As a map reader, you should always be aware of the invisible hand of the map maker. Never use a map without asking yourself how it has been biased by the methods used to make it. 
    If the entire map making process operates at its full potential, communication takes place between the map maker and the user. The map maker translates reality into the clearest possible picture under the circumstances, and the map reader converts this picture back into an impression of the environment. For such communication to take place, the map reader as the map maker must know something about how maps are created. 
21. Map is a lie _________ . 
[A] that has little truth in it 
[B] that few of us believe 
[C] that we use to express the truth 
[D] that cheats people in a tricky way 
22. Map resembles art in that ________ . 
[A] they are both absolute lies 
[B] they are both precise as well as fanciful 
[C] they must be read with imagination 
[D] they both express meanings in a superficial way 
23. Most map reading mistakes occur because ________ . 
[A] the map is not made according to reality 
[B] there are obvious differences between the map and reality 
[C] the user forgets the one-to-one correspondence between the map and reality 
[D] the user overlooks the gap between the map and reality 
24. "the invisible hand of the map maker"（in Paragraph3）refers to ________ . 
[A] the techniques used to create maps 
[B] the subject matter of the map 
[C] the symbols used in the map 
[D] the final representation of the map 
25. The last paragraph describes mainly ________ . 
[A] how maps are created 
[B] what the communication between the map maker and the reader is 
[C] how the map maker translates reality into a picture 
[D] how the reader converts the picture back into reality 
Passage Two 
Questions26 to30 are based on the following passage. 
    Music which is original is individual and personal. That is to say, it can be identified as belonging to a particular composer. It has particular qualities, or a style, which are not copied from another. If you can recognize the style of a composer, you will probably be able to tell that a certain composition belongs to him or her even though you have never heard it before. A basket-maker has the skill of weaving and interweaving his materials to create colorful patterns, and an expert carpenter（木匠）has the skill of joining together different shapes and sizes of wood to make a beautiful piece of furniture. These skills may　be referred to as "workmanship"（技艺）. Similarly, in music a composer organizes his melodies（旋律）and rhythms and combines sounds to create harmony. A composer may be capable of thinking up very good, original tunes, yet if tunes are poorly organized, that is, if the workmanship is poor, the final result will not be to standard. 
    Good music expresses feelings in a way that is suitable to those feelings. There may e joy, sorrow, fear, love, anger, or whatever. Bad music, on the other hand, may confuse unrelated feelings, it may not express any important feeling at all, or it may exaggerate some feelings and make them vulgar, that is, cheap and ugly. 
    Good music will stand the test of time. It will not go out of fashion but will continue to be enjoyed and respected long after it is first introduced. It will gain a kind of permanent status while bad music will disappear and be forgotten quickly. In pop music, where the general rule seems to be"the newer the better", the test of time is the hardest test of all to pass. 
26. A piece of original music ________. 
[A] has a personal style 
[B] sounds very familiar to our ears 
[C] is one whose style you cannot recognize 
[D] can not be recognized as belonging to any composer 
27. We can see good workmanship in ________. 
[A] different shapes and size of furniture 
[B] materials for creating colourful patterns 
[C] a piece of music with its melodies and rhythms organized in harmony 
[D] a piece of music with very good, original tunes mixed together 
28. A piece of music can be said to be good if _________. 
[A] it helps to while away the hours 
[B] it combines different rhythms and sounds 
[C] it makes people forget their sorrows and worries quickly 
[D] it expresses a certain feeling in a proper way 
29.According to the last paragraph, "the test of time is the hardest of all to pass" suggests that ________. 
[A] the newer the music is, the harder it can pass the test of time 
[B] it is most difficult for music to gain a kind of permanent status 
[C] pop music will cease to be enjoyed soon after it is introduced 
[D] good music needn't pass the test of time 
30.This passage is concerned with ________. 
[A] how to compose music 
[B] how to enjoy music 
[C] how to judge music 
[D] how to perform music 
Passage Three 
Questions31 to35 are based on the following passage. 
    To be"historically minded"is to see things I relation and in perspective, and to judge tolerantly. We must remember how differently men have thought and acted in different times. We must always keep an open mind, ready to receive and weigh new evidence. If we grasp this idea, we will never think that a historian（历史学家）is someone who can remember dates. That childish idea is like calling a man a statesman（政治家）because he can remember the names of voters in his district. A waiter could remember more names and a telephone operator more numbers than the greatest historian. 
    The true historian is not content to take all his facts from other historians. Today he makes sure that his statements are based on sound"documents"or"sources"which go back to the time of the facts themselves. But the historian needs always to be in his guard not to be misled by his sources. A document may not be a real one. Its author may be lying on purpose for some reason. He may be so greatly influenced by national, religious, party, or personal backgrounds as to be totally unfair to the other side. If honest, he may be misinformed as to the facts and mistaken in his inferences. 
    Anyone who reads the accounts published in the different countries concerning the causes and results of wars will realize that the historian needs caution and training in handling these sources. The trained historian asks first:"Did this writer mean to tell the truth?"and second:"Was he in a position or frame of mind to tell the truth even if he wants to?"Every statement must be patiently weighed and tested and combined with all other available information in order to get at the truth. 
31. A "historically minded"researcher _________. 
[A] always keeps an open mind to history 
[B] looks at one historical event without relating it to another 
[C] sees things from a single point of view 
[D] refuses to accept new evidence 
32. In Paragraph1 the author means to illustrate that ________. 
[A] different men think and act differently 
[B] the study of history is not merely a matter of remembering dates 
[C] a statesman can remember the names of voters in his district 
[D] a waiter can remember more names than the great historians 
33. The true historian should base his statements on ________. 
[A] findings of other historians 
[B] documents created at the present time 
[C] his own inferences 
[D] sound historical materials 
34. Which of the following is the topic of Paragraph3? 
[A] Some historical documents may not be real. 
[B] Some authors may not be honest. 
[C] Historians should be careful about their sources. 
[D] Historians may be influenced by their own background. 
35. It is emphasized in the last paragraph that ________. 
[A] wars are accounted for differently in different countries 
[B] the historian needs caution and training in dealing with his sources 
[C] some writers may not be telling the truth 
[D] some writers may not be in a position or frame of mind to tell the truth

Ⅵ.Translation from English into Chinese（15 points） 
将下列短文译成汉语并将答案写在答题纸上。 
    Although students of all subjects are judged by their performance in course work and examinations, they may be given little or no advice on study, revision or examination techniques. 
    Those who know that they are working hard, yet feel that they are not doing as well as they could either in course work or examinations, are likely to benefit most from straightforward advice-because they know that they need help. However, students who are satisfied with their progress can also be helped to do even better work, just as talented athletes（运动员）can improve their performance when well coached. 
    It would obviously be best, therefore, in their first few weeks at college, if all students were to consider how to use their study and leisure time. Learning to work effectively（to think, understand, select, organize, and explain or remember）would help them not only at college but also in any career.
