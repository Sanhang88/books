Part Two 
Read the following passage carefully and complete the succeeding for items:Ⅴ，Ⅵ，Ⅶ and Ⅷ. 
1）How shall we begin to talk with one another all around the globe? What language shall we use? Must we forever be dependent on interpreters? The realization of the dream of world-wide communication and the growing belief that men can plan for change are opening new potentialities for human relationships. But there is a paradox. For although our ability 
to see and hear has been vastly expanded, we still cannot talk with one another easily or on an equal basis. With every door of communication opening wide, we are held back by the barrier of language. 
2）In the past, when only a few travelers made their way to far-off places, they translated their experiences of new landscapes and new peoples, strange sights and sounds and smells, as best they could into their own tongue. And when people went abroad as conquerors, traders or colonists, two things were very likely to happen. Those who were dominant imposed 
their own language as the high-level mode of communication；and very often they made use of a trade language or "pidgin"as a low-level mode of communication. Both practices accentuated the differences of those who came into contact with one another. 
3）Today all this is changing, and perhaps the necessity of making a new choice presents to us a unique opportunity. The very rapid movement of jokes and slangs, fashions and fads and slogans from one continent to another suggests that even now people, especially young people, This may well be the moment to establish a secondary world language that all the world's peoples will learn, in addition to their own, for use around the whole earth. 
4）There are those who believe that the choice is already being made. They point to the number of people everywhere who are using one or another of the major languages for business, science and international politics. If they are right, sooner or later the languages of the most populous and powerful advanced nations will swamp the smaller languages and the world 
will be more strongly than ever divided into blocs. But I believe the choice is still open. If we can move fast enough, we may arrive at a decision that will bring people everywhere into more meaningful contact. 
5）A few decades ago, some people campaigned for a world language. They believed that the beginning of world community depended on the invention of a new, artificial language for world-wide use. Since this would be the language of no nation, it could, without offending anyone, become everyone's language. 
6）What these pioneers did not notice, however, was that each of these invented languages, because it was basically 
a simplification of existing European languages, would still give tremendous advantages to those who spoke any one of them. Conversely, these artificial languages offered little to all those with a different linguistic tradition. So the various candidate languages were tried out --- in vain. This, of course, did a great deal of harm, for with each failure the danger increased that more people would treat the idea and the advocates of an auxiliary universal language as silly, boring and cranky. 
7）Why, then, are we coning back to the idea? In fact, we have not "come back" but moved in a new direction. Recently students of the relationship between language and culture, working together with the new scientists of the cybernetic* revolution, have learned about the natural languages --- all languages that have been moulded by the speech of many people over many generations. 
8）A language that works has been shaped by its people. A natural language allows for the whole range of human intelligence and responsiveness and it is far richer and more expressive than are any individual's capacities for using it. And this is why, if we are to have a universal language, it must be a natural language. It must have the complex resources on which all the world's people can draw. But it cannot be one of the present-day major languages now in competition. For we need to protect all the languages there are. Soon diversity of language will be the principal remaining evidence of man's extraordinary inventiveness in creating different ways of living. 
9）In time, this is also what a universal secondary language must carry for the peoples of the whole world - the significance of worldwide talking with one another within a shared civilization. If we chose as a secondary language the natural language of a small, olitically unimportant, non-European literate people, we could accomplish our several purposes. 
10）It can be done now. It may be very difficult to do later.
