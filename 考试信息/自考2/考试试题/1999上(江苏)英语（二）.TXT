Passage 2 
Bagel sales up 
    The pastries at this bakery near Washington, D.C. are sweet and pleasing to the eye, but nearly all of the customers have come here for something else. You hear customers say, "Plain bagel to go please." The reporter explained, "It is this mix of flour, water, salt, malt and yeast, that has produced one of the l990's hottest trends in U.S. retailing." "The little round rolls known as bagels are now generating $1 billion a year in sales. And everybody seems to want bagels." 
    "I like it better than sweet things and it is a healthier choice." 
    "I was in here last weekend I think and I counted a hundred and seventy come in within an hour, hour and a half. That's amazing," said a customer. 
    Sales of bagels in the U.S. are growing at the astonishing rate of 8% a year. In Washington D.C. the rate of increase is even greater. Washington's Chesapeake Bagel Bakeries began with a single store in l981. Today there are 30, with ten new ones set to open in the year ahead. The chain is moving into the national market, and looking to expand internationally. Alan Manstof is president of Chesapeake. He and his friend Michael Robinson started the business. 
    "Our philosophy is we make the bagel from scratch at every location with the machinery. So the customer gets the opportunity to have the freshest product available." 
    "And they can get a fresh hot bagel almost every minute of the day." 
    "It's an all American product and we think in reality it's an all world product." 
    Bake a better bagel and the world will beat a path to your door, but store owner Tom Rygle knows that variety is still the spice of life. He said, "Well I'm carrying 16 different bagels right now". 
    "What I'm making now is a blueberry bagel." 
    Whether the bagels are plain or fruit-flavored, man does not live by bread alone. People love to add toppings to bagels. 
    Tom Rygle said, "I would say the combinations are endless." 
    One customer asked, "Is that Pizza bagel for here or to go?" 
    As long as People continue to eat bread, and until the number of combinations exhausts itself, it seems likely that bagelmania will continue to run its course. 
    "Plain with sausage and American cheese, sesame with cream cheese, and a sour dough. What a variety !" 
24. Judging by the context, which of the following do you think the word "bagelmania" means ? 
A. People do not like bagels. 
B. People hate bagels. 
C. People often eat bagels. 
D. People are madly in love with bagels. 
25. When ordering a bagel, one customer said, "Plain bagel to go please." The meaning of "to go" is _________. 
A. to take away 
B. to go to a plate 
C. to be eaten here in the store 
D. to be made quickly 
26. According to this passage the hottest trend in U.S. retailing should include _______ . 
A. bread in general 
B. bagels in particular 
C. all pastry food 
D. fast food 
Passage 3 
Cheetah Breeding (猎豹繁殖） 
    The Cheetah...It is the fastest mammal on earth. Experts believe it can run mere than 100 kilometers an hour. The cheetah is also an endangered species. Loss of natural habitat（栖息地）and severe reproductive problems have reduced its numbers in the wild to about 2,000. 
    However intense efforts are under way to save the animal. The national zoo in Washington, D.C. opened a new cheetah exhibit in the summer of 1992. 
    The exhibit was designed to recreate the animals' natural habitat in Africa so that the cheetahs will behave as they do in the wild, and trained volunteers can observe those behaviors. Exhibit manager Stuart Wells says they will use the data to determine the best times to breed them. 
    "The behavior study that we are doing on the cheetahs is unique in the sense that we are trying to pick up subtle behavior changes in the cheetah. And when those changes occur, are they occurring when the female is in estrus（发情）. And based on those changes, based on the data that we have gathered, we construct a management plan that is designed to create those circumstances where the female is most receptive to breeding. So they are watching behaviors like treading and urine marking and rolling." 
    Scientists at the National Zoo also are studying ways to improve cheetah reproduction through the use of techniques such as artificial insemination. It is a difficult task because nearly all male cheetahs have low sperm counts and a high frequency of abnormal sperm. 
    Despite the problems, Dr. Jogayle Howard says they are beginning to make real progress in breeding cheetahs and other endangered animals. 
    "We have found that after about 10 years of working on it and not giving up, we finally have developed the right way to collect semen, to process it, to even freeze the semen for long-term storage, and then just recently, after many years of research, we finally have had the artificial insemination （人工受精）technique successful in the cats, and including the cheetahs." 
    Three cheetahs at two zoos in the southern state of Texas have given birth to healthy cubs after being artificially inseminated by Dr. Howard. Such successes may play an important role in ensuring that animals like the cheetah do not become extinct. 
27. The Cheetah would not disappear from the Earth because ________. 
A. they are tough animals 
B. they have 1earned to survive by themselves 
C. scientists are doing research 
D. of the successes of artificial insemination on Cheetahs 
28. Cheetahs are naturally found in _________. 
A. South America 
B. North America 
C. Asia 
D. Africa 
29. What is Unique about the behavior study on the Cheetah lies in the sense that observers _________. 
A. are trying to find the best time for the female Cheetah to become pregnant 
B. want to know how the Cheetah urinate 
C. are making efforts to find the treading of Cheetahs 
D. are keen on how Cheetahs roll 
30. The difficulty for making Cheetahs to breed also lies in the fact that ________. 
A. there are not many Cheetahs left in the world 
B. both male and female Cheetahs do not mate at all 
C. the female does not produce eggs easily 
D. the male does not produce a lot of normal sperms
