    Tourism is the temporary movement of people to destinations outside their normal places of work and residence(居住),the activities 11 during their stay in those destinations, and the facilities created to 12 their needs.
    Tourism is a luxury. Until recently, participation 13 restricted to the select few 14 could afford both the time and money to travel. 15 ,increased leisure and higher incomes have combined to enable more people to join in. Improvements in transportation, and the growth of inclusive(全包的)tours and other forms of relatively cheap vacation travel, have further 16 the opportunity to travel for pleasure. Today the majority of people in the developed world and increasing numbers in the developing countries are tourists 17 some time in their lives. Tourism is no longer the special right of a few but is an accepted and 18 expected part of the life-styles of a large and growing number of people.
    Tourism is 19 major economic and social significance. More than 270 million tourists spend $92 billion(US)annually in places outside their own countries. This is one of the largest items in the world's foreign trade. With a world growth in visitor arrival rate of 20 6 per cent per year, tourism is also one of the fastest growing economic activities. It is the most important export industry and earner of foreign exchange in many countries.

III. Reading Comprehension(30 points, 2 points for each item)
从下列每篇短文的问题后所给的四个选择项中选出一个最佳答案，并在答题卡上将相应的字母涂黑。
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
    By the Treaty of Paris of 1763, which ended the war with the French and the Indians, England gained possession of Canada and all the territory east of the Mississippi River. French influence on this continent thus came to an end; England now controlled most of North America. But the war had been long and expensive. England had many debts. George III, king of England, after consulting with his advisers, decided that the American colonists(殖民者)should help pay some of the expenses of this war. A standing English army of 10,000 men had been left in the colonies(殖民地)for protection against the Indians. The English government also felt that the colonists should share in the expenses of maintaining this army. The result was a series of measures, the Grenville Program, passed by Parliament and designed to raise money in the colonies. Some of these measures were accepted by the colonists, but one in particular, the Stamp Act, was met with great protest. The Stamp Act required that stamps, ranging in price from a few cents to almost a dollar, be placed on all newspapers, advertisements, bills of sale, wills, legal papers, etc. The Stamp Act was one of the causes of the American Revolution. It affected everyone, rich and poor alike. Some businessmen felt that the act would surely ruin their businesses.
    Of all the voices raised in protest to the Stamp Act, none had greater effect than that of a young lawyer from Virginia - Patrick Henry. Henry had only recently been elected to the Virginia Assembly. Yet when the Stamp Act came up for discussion, he opposed it almost single-handedly. He also expressed, for the first time, certain ideas that were held by many Americans of the time but that never before had been stated so openly. 'Is life so dear or peace so sweet, as to be bought at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty(万能的)God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!'
21.From the text we learn that ___________________.

B、there had been a war between the French and the Indians which ended in 1763
C、France used to have control of Canada and some areas east of the Mississippi River

B、the British government's desire to raise money in North America
C、a plan to share the expenses of maintaining an army in the American colonies
D、a decision of the British Parliament to collect money in the American colonies
23.The Stamp Act ___________________.
A、was an act about selling stamps at prices from a few cents to almost a dollar
B、required that all commercial and legal documents in America have stamps on them
C、was the main cause of the American Revolution
D、chiefly affected business people who felt it would ruin their businesses
24.From the text we learn that Patrick Henry ___________________.
A、had been a member of the Virginia Assembly for a long time
B、didn't know what courses to take to complete his studies as a lawyer
C、was almost the only one who openly protested against the Stamp Act
D、didn't value life or peace as much as other people did

B、the Treaty of Paris between Britain and France
C、the Grenville Program to raise money in the American colonies
D、Patrick Henry, a hero who opposed the Stamp Act
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
    A number of recent books have reworked subjects, forms and writing techniques. Today's children read stories about divorce, death, drugs, air pollution, political extremism and violence. Relying on the magic of the illustrator, all kinds of books are being published.
    Before they know to read, babies can play with books made of cloth or books made to take in the bath. Later on, they are given picture books that may be cubical(立方形的)or triangular, outsized or very small. They also like work-books which come with watercolours and paintbrushes, and comic books(漫画册)filled with details where they have to spot a figure hidden among thousands of others.
    Not that the traditional children's books are being neglected. There are still storybooks where the pages pop up(跳起)when they are opened, to make a forest or a castle. Among the latest ideas are interactive stories where readers choose the plot(情节)or ending they want, and books on CD, which are very popular in rich industrialized countries.
    The public has enthusiastically greeted the wealth of creativity displayed by publishers. 'Previously, giving a child a book as often seen as improper,' says Canadian author Marie-France Hebért. Her books, published by a French-language publisher, sell like hot cakes in hundreds of thousands of copies. 'There's a real appetite for reading these days and I try to get across to children the passion for reading which is food for the mind and the heart, like a medicine or a vitamin.'
26.'Reworked' as used in Paragraph 1 means '___________________'.
A、reworded
B、rewritten
C、processed
D、revised
27.In the second paragraph the author lists the kinds of books ___________________.

B、When you buy work-books you will be given free comic books.
C、Traditional children's books are not being removed from market.

29.The expression 'get across to children' in the last paragraph probably means '___________________'.
A、pass on to children
B、make children believe
C、teach children
D、get around to children
30.The main idea of the last paragraph is that people have ___________________.
A、warmly welcomed the abundance of wealth shown by publishers
B、warmly welcomed the enormous amount of creativity shown by publishers
C、showed great enthusiasm in publishers of treat wealty
D、reacted strongly to the unlimited creativity of publishers
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
    Every body gets sick. Disease and injury make us suffer throughout our lives until, finally, some attack on the body brings our existence to an end. Fortunately, most of us in modern industrialized societies can take relatively good health for granted most of the time. In fact, we tend to fully realize the importance of good health only when we or those close to us become seriously ill. At such times we keenly appreciate the ancient truth that health is our most precious asset, one for which we might readily give up such rewards as power, wealth, or fame(荣誉).
    Because ill health is universal problem, affecting both the individual and society, the human response to sickness is always socially organized. No society leaves the responsibility for maintaining health and treating ill health entirely to the individual. Each society develops its own concepts of health and sickness and authorizes certain people to decide who is sick and how the sick should be treated. Around this focus there arises, over time, a number of standards, values, groups, statuses, and roles: in other words, an institution(体系；机构).To the sociologist(社会学家), then, medicine is the institution concerned with the maintenance of health and treatment of disease.
    In the simplest pre-industrial societies, medicine is usually an aspect of religion. The social arrangements for dealing with sickness are very elementary, often involving only two roles: the sick and the healer(治疗者).The latter is typically also the priest(牧师), who relies primarily on religious ceremonies, both to identify and to treat disease: for example, bones may be thrown to establish a cause, songs may be used to bring about a cure. In modern industrialized societies, on the other hand, the institution has become highly complicated and specialized, including dozens of roles such as those of brain surgeon, druggist, hospital administrator, linked with various organizations such as nursing homes, insurance companies, and medical schools. Medicine, in fact, has become the subject of intense sociological interest precisely because it is now one of the most pervasive and costly institutions of modern society.
31.Which of the following statements is true according to Paragraph 1?
A、Nowadays most people believe they can have fairly good health.
B、Human life involves a great deal of pain and suffering.
C、Most of us are aware of the full value of health.
D、Ancient people believed that health was more expensive than anything else.
32.The word 'authorize' in Paragraph 2 means '___________________'.
A、make way for
B、give power to
C、write an order for
D、make it possible for
33.In Paragraph 2, we learn that the sociologist regards medicine as ___________________.
A、a system whose purpose is to treat disease and keep people healthy
B、a universal problem that affects every society
C、a social responsibility to treat ill health
D、a science that focuses on the treatment of disease
34.According to Paragraph 3, which of the following is NOT true?
A、In the past, bones might be used to decide why people fell ill.
B、In pre-industrial societies priests sometimes treated patients by singing.
C、Modern medicine is so complicated that sociology no longer has a place in it.
D、There were only two roles in an elementary medical system, the patient and the one who tried to cure him.
35.The author of this passage is mainly concerned with ___________________.
A、sociological aspects in medicine
B、medical treatment of diseases
C、the development of medical science
D、the role of religion in medicine
