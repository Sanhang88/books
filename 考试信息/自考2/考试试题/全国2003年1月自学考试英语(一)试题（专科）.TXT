Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
    For many years ,T-shirts were simple short-sleeved undershirts for men and boys. T-shirts used to be of one color－white. And since they were worn under shirts, they were generally not seen.
    Today the T-shirt has become fashionable. It can be seen everywhere and on everyone. Women and little children wear T-shirts as do teenagers, university students, and men from all walks of life (各行各业).T-shirts are worn on playground, at the beach or in town. They can also be worn for work. Yet T-shirts remain relatively inexpensive and long wearing, as well as easy to care for. Smart but comfortable and convenient to wear, they have become one of American's newest ideas on fashion.
    Although T-shirts are now available in a wide variety of bright materials and styles, the most popular kind is the traditional cotton T-shirts with a slogan or picture printed on the front.

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
    False teeth have been found in Italy in human heads that are over 2,500 years old. They were made of bone and set in gold. However, for hundreds of years afterwards, the apparent dental skill of those early people was lost. Without false teeth people looked old before their time, since so many lost their teeth at an early age.
    Toward the end of the 17th century, rich people could buy false teeth made from ivory. The teeth were tied together with silk thread, but it was difficult to keep them in the mouth. That was why rich people would rather buy teeth from the poor who would often sell their teeth to buy food and clothing.
    Early in the 18th century a French doctor used steel springs to hold teeth in place. However, it was difficult to close one's mouth! Late in the same century porcelain (瓷)teeth set in gold were often used to make false teeth.
    Although the use of artificial teeth increased, human teeth continued to be used also. In the 19th century, teeth from soldiers killed in battle were made into artificial teeth. For example, teeth from the dead in the American Civil War were sent to England.
    By the middle of the 19th century, an American doctor, Claudius Ash, invented a better kind of porcelain tooth made of a special kind of hard rubber.
26.When did people with the earliest false teeth live according to the passage?
[A] At the end of the 17th century.
[B] In the early 18th century.
[C] In the middle of the 19th century.
[D] Over 2,500 years ago.
27.Which material would wealthy people use to make artificial teeth in 1693?

[C] Ivory.  [D] Bone.
28.Who first used steel springs to tie false teeth together according to the passage?

[C] An American doctor. [D] An English doctor.
29.We can learn from the passage that ___________.
[A] one looked older than his real age with artificial teeth
[B] we are using the same method as ancient people in making false teeth
[C] poor people would often sell their teeth to get money in the 17th century
[D] human teeth were no longer used in making false teeth after the 18th century
30.The passage is mainly about ___________.
[A] the discovery of false teeth [B] the material of false teeth
[C] the use of false teeth [D] the history of false teeth
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
    Trademarks (商标) identify and distinguish the products of one business firm from those of another. It may include a word, a sentence, a name, a symbol, a picture, or any combination of these. Trademarks must be attached directly to the product. Many trademarks contain the name of the owner of the business. But manufacturers often use some word to describe the qualities of the product, or make up a word. The spoken part of a trademark is called the brand name.
    Trademarks provide a simple way for people to determine who is responsible for a particular item. They also help people identify the brands they liked in the past so they may purchase them again. Manufacturers use trademarks to promote the sale of their goods.
    Service marks also identify goods and services. They do not have to be attached to a product. Companies that provide services to the public, such as transportation companies, use these marks to advertise their services. For example, a blue sign with a bell, the symbol of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, tells every passer-by that a public telephone is available for use.
    Laws to protect the rights of the trademark owner were developed in the early 1800's.Most countries now provide for regulation and registration of trademarks. An important protection for trademark rights is federal　(联邦的)registration. In 1905, the U.S. Congress passed the first federal law on trademark registration to be held constitutional.
31.What may NOT be included in a trademark as mentioned in the first paragraph?
[A] A nice picture.
[B] A meaningful symbol.
[C] A national flag.
[D] A person's name.
32.We learn from the second paragraph that trademarks are useful in that ___________.
[A] they help manufacturers to control the prices of their products
[B] they offer people the information about market in a simple way
[C] they make customers aware of their own responsibility for the items
[D] they enable customers to purchase the goods they prefer
33.The word "promote" in the last sentence, paragraph 2, probably means "____________".
[A] to give higher position or rank
[B] to try to increase the popularity
[C] to keep safe from harm or danger
[D] to make a promise
34.According to the third paragraph, a blue sign with a bell ____________.
[A] is not a trademark but a symbol
[B] is a trademark of transportation
[C] stands for a kind of service
[D] stands for a road map
35.Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?
[A] Trademarks must be attached to all products.

将下列短文译成汉语并将答案写在答题纸上。
    There are lots of reasons for buying a new mattress (床垫) :getting married, moving to a new home or simply the desire for more sleeping space. No matter what the reason, the ultimate expectation is a good, restful night's sleep.
    But with all the different constructions, firmness, sizes and prices for sleep sets, how do you decide which one is right for you? The makers suggest you treat bedding as a long-term investment. This means carefully considering the quality and comfort you are getting for your money.
    If you've decided to buy a new mattress, invest in the very best you can afford. Prices are determined by the material used, the quality of construction and the size of the set. It's an investment in one-third of everyday of your life and that can have a dramatic effect on how you feel the other two-thirds.
