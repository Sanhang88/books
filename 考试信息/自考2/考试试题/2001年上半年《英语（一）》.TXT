    Faces, like fingerprints are unique. Did you 11 wonder how it is possible for us to 12 people? Even a skilled writer probably could not describe all the 13 that make one face different from another. Yet a very young child-- 14 an animal, such as a cat----can learn to recognize faces. We all 15 this ability for granted.
    We also tell people 16 by observing how they behave .When we talk about someone's personality, we mean the 17 in which he or she acts, speaks, thinks or feels that 18 that individual different from others.
    Like the human face, human personality is very complex. But describing someone's personality 19 words is somewhat easier than 20 his face.

III. Reading Comprehension (30 points, 2 points for each)
从下列每篇短文的问题后所给的四个选项中选出一个最佳答案，并在答题卡上将相应的字母涂黑。
Passage one
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
    Many visitors finds the fast pace at which American people move very troubling. One's first impression is likely to be that everyone is in a rush .City people always appear to be hurrying to get where they are going and are very impatient if they are delayed even for a brief moment.
    At first, this may seem unfriendly to you . But drivers will rush you ; storekeepers will be in a hurry as they serve you ; people will push past you as they walk along the street . You will miss smiles, brief conversations with people as you shop or dine away from home . Do not think that because Americans are in such a hurry they are unfriendly. Often , life is much slower outside the big cities, as is true in other countries as well.
    Americans who live in cities such as New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles, often think that everyone is equally in a hurry to get things done; they expect others to 'push back', just as city people do in Tokyo, Singapore or Paris, for example . But when they discover that you are a stranger, most Americans become quite kindly and will take great care to help you. Many of them first came to the city as strangers and they remember how frightening a new city can be .If you need help or want to ask a question , choose a friendly looking person and say,' I am a stranger here. Can you help me ?'
    Most people will stop, smile at you, and help you find you way or answer your questions. But you must let them know that you need help. Otherwise they are likely to pass you by, not noticing that you are new to the city and in need of help. Occasionally, you may find someone too busy or perhaps too rushed to give you aid. If this happens, do not be discouraged; just ask someone else. Most Americans enjoy helping a stranger.
21. Many people who first visit the United States will find that _______.
[A] America is a highly developed country
[B] American city people seem to be always in a rush

[C] you will feel that Americans do not seem very friendly
[D] you will find that Americans don't have much sense of humor
23. In the author's opinion, ___________.
[A] it is true that life in New York is much faster than that in any other city
[B] people living outside big cities are lazy and miserable
[C] most American people enjoy living in the suburbs of big cities
[D] those who are busy are not necessarily unfriendly
24. The author mentions big cities such as Tokyo, Singapore and Paris ___________.
[A] to show that city people all over the world have a lot in common
[B] to let his readers be aware that they are some of the world's biggest cities
[C] to illustrate their difference from American cities
[D] because they are some of the cities that attract visitors most

[D] reply that he is pleased to meet you
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
    Mark felt that it was time for him to take part in his community, so he went to the neighborhood meeting after work.. The area's city councilwoman (女议员) was leading a discussion about how the quality of life was decreasing . The neighborhood faced many problems.
    Mark looked at the charts taped to the walls. There are charts for parking problems, crime, and for problems in vacant buildings . People were supposed to suggest solutions to the councilwoman..
    It was too much for Mark. ' The problems are too big ,' he thought . He turned to the man next to him and said, 'I think this is a waste of my time . Nothing I could do would make a difference here.'
    Mark thought some more on his way to the bus stop. 'People should just take care of themselves , ' he decided. 'That's enough to do . I can't take on all the problems of the world.'
    As he neared the bus stop, Mark saw a woman carrying a grocery bag and baby. She was trying to unlock her car, but she didn't have a free hand . As Mark got closer, her other child , a littlle boy , suddenly darted into the street. The woman tried to reach for him, but as she moved, her bag shifted and groceries started to fall out . Mark ran to take the boy's arm and led him back to his mother. Then he picked up the groceries while the woman smiled in relief. 'Thanks!' she said . ' You've got great timing!'
    'Just being neighborly,' Mark said . As he rode home, he glanced at the walls of the bus. On one of them was ' Small acts of kindness add up .' Mark smiled and thought, ' Maybe that's a good place to start.'
26. It is known from the passage that _________.
[A] Mark played an active part in community activities

[B] running a neighborhood meeting to solve its problems
[C] citizens' reactions to the problems they face
[D] solving problems through group action
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
    In every society it is necessary to have a general system of laws to ensure justice. Laws are designed to make certain that people's rights are protected and that people respect each other's rights. Sometimes, however, laws are passed which are specific to a time or situation. For example , a town in Indiana once passed a law making it illegal to shoot open a can of food . Apparently, some gun-carrying citizens forgot their can openers and naturally enough, used their guns to do the job. This disturbed other citizens, and endangered their lives, so a law was passed to prevent it.
    Specific laws sometimes remain in existence long after the problem has disappeared. The laws then seem strange. For example , the Indiana law was no longer necessary when citizens stopped carrying guns and using them as can openers. Since the law was no longer needed, what once made sense now seems like nonsense.
    Sometimes laws designed to serve a good purpose were passed but somehow these became mixed up in their wording. As a result, the laws don't make sense. In one state there is a law which says that it is 'illegal to move or to attempt to move a motor vehicle.' Obvionsly, a massive traffic jam would occur if everyone suddenly obeyed that law . But no one does, of course, because the intention of the law was not to prevent owners from moving their own cars . It was to prevent people from moving (stealing) other people's cars.
    It is often harder to repeal (废止)a law than to pass one, so many of these old laws remain in existence. Because they no longer fit the way people live or because the problem no longer exists, these laws are ignored. Everyone understands that and life goes on. Thus, laws that once made very good sense, now seem like nonsense.
31. According to the passage, laws are designed for the purpose of ____________.
[A] protecting people's rights
[B] making people respect each other
[C] preventing gun-carrying
[D] punishing criminals
32. The word 'job ' in paragraph 1 refers to ___________.
[A] working
[B] shooting
[C] preventing gun-carrying
[D] disturbing others
33. The author used the Indiana law as an example to explain _________.
[A] how some laws are passed and changed
[B] how people in Indiana open cans
[C] why some laws may seem strange
[D] why people in Indiana no longer use their guns
34. What's the problem with the law concerning motor vehicles?
[A] It leads to traffic jams.
[B] It is not clearly written.
[C] It is not designed to serve a good purpose.
[D] It has been out of date.
35. We can conclude from the passage that ___________.
[A] a law system is necessary for every society
[B] some laws that don't make sense may also get passed
[C] it is more difficult to change the old law than pass a new one
[D] some laws may seem strange as time passes

    Many Americans find silence uncomfortable .They will talk continually to fill any pause in a conversation, even if it lasts only for a moment. If you are silent for long periods of time, Americans will do their best to include you in the conversation. They may ask you if you are feeling well or if there is anything they can do to help you . However ,if Americans disagree with what you are saying, they may remain quiet. This does not necessarily mean that they agree with you; often it only means that they consider it impolite to argue further.

很多美国人感到沉默很不舒服，他们会侃侃而谈，不让谈话中断，即使只有片刻停也非所愿。假如你久久一言不发，美国人会设法让你加入谈话。他们也许会问你身体是否舒服，或者是否需要他们帮忙。但是，如果美国人不同意你的意见，他们会默不作声。这样做未必表示他们同意你的意见，常常只表示他们认为继续同你辩论下去不合礼仪。
