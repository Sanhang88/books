Passage 1
    I still remember the days when my younger sisters joined my family．The first one arrived on a cold winter day．The hospital was crowded with excited adults filling and darkening a tiny hallway（走廊）．There was hardly enough room for me,although I was just a little boy no higher than anyone's thigh（大腿）．There was a door with a high window in it．Suddenly, a red-faced,dark-headed tiny baby appeared in the window,held by a nurse．"It looks like a monkey!" I cried out,excited,proud of the cleverness of my description．And the adults silenced me in shocked tones．
    When my mother was in hospital to give birth to my youngest sster,I was left with my grandparents．During my stay whi them，I fell and broke my leg,whick required astay in the hospital not the same one as my mother's and the wearing of of a full cast（石膏）,thigh to toe．I insisted that I go with them to bring my mother and the bady home．They agreed．I was put in the backseat of the car,with a blanket covering my cast．My aunt and my grandmo ther warned me that I should not tell my mother about the cast,because it would upset her．We arrived at the hospital,and my mother,baby in arms,bent into the car with oyful face to greet me．Ilnoring all I was told,I threw back the blanket．"Look,Ma！"My mother stared at the cast,her mouth wide open．I saw her almost drop the baby．

Passage 2
    China and the United States seem vastly different,and comparing them seems like comparing apples and oragnes．Yet,there are not only obvious differences but also surprising similarities between them．
    Geographically,the continental United States is remarkably like China．Its area is almost exactly that of China, two percent less,to be accurate．In both,thedistance from the eastern to the western boundary（边界） is about 5,000 kilometers．In their western regions, both countries have many mountains．
    While their lands may be the same size, their populations difinitely are not．The population of the U．S．is only 22 percent as large as that of China．However,thinking that the U．S is 22 percent as densely(稠密) populated as China would actually miss the difference．China's population is mostly in the countryside while America's mostly in towns;so Amer ica's smaller rural(农村)population is very thinly spread,indeed,compared with China's．
    In spite of these differences,we find in both countries the piling up of population in the east．It is not really important that a populaiton density is found in the outheast of China and in the northeast of the United States;in both cases of China and in the northeast of the United States;in both cases the densities in the eastern provinces, or states,are more than ten times as great as those for the west．
36．According to Paragraph 1,the quthor thinks that China and the U．S．______.

B．The U．S．is 22 percent as thinly populated as China
C．China's population is over four times that of the U．S．
D．China's rural population is smaller,compared with America's
39．Both China and the U．S．have a dense population ______.
