Part I Listening Comprehension (20 minutes略)

Part  II Reading  Comprehension (35  minutes) Directions:  There are  4 reading
passage in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions　or  unfinished
statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D).  You
should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer
Sheet with a single line through the centre. Passage One Questions 21 to 25  are
based on the following passage:

There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in
spelling. No school I have taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered  it
unimportant as a basic  skill There are ,  however, vastly different deas  about
how to teach it ,  or how much priority it  must be given over general  language
development  and  writing without  holding  him back  with  the complexities  of
spelling? If spelling  becomes the only  focal point of  his teacher's interest,
clearly a bright child will be likely to "play safe". He will tend to write only
words within his spelling range , choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's
why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention  to
content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the  bottom
of a  sensitive piece  of writing  about a  personal experience:  "This work  is
terrible! There are far too many  spelling errors and your writing is  illegible
." It  may have  been a  sharp criticism  of the  pupil's technical abilities in
writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read
the  essay ,  which contained  some beautiful  expressions of  the child's  deep
feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors , but if his
priorities had centred on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment
with  the  presentation would  have  given the  pupil  more motivation  to  seek
improvement.

A)the  difficulties  in teaching  spelling  B)the role  of  spelling in  general
language  development  C)the  complexities of  the  basic  writing skills  D)the
necessity of teaching spelling


22.The expression "play safe" probably means "_______".

A)to write carefully  B)to do as  teachers say C)to  use dictionaries frequently
D)to avoid using words one is not sure of


23.Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that ______.

A)students will be able to express their ideas more freely B)teachers will  have
less trouble  in correcting  mistakes C)students  will have  more confidence  in
writing D)students will learn to be independent of teachers


24. The writer  seems to think  that the teacher's  judgement on that  sensitive
piece of writing is ______.

A)reasonable B)unfair C)foolish D)careless


25.The major point discussed in the passage is ________

Passage  Two  Questions  26  to  30  are  based  on  the  following  passage:  A
breakthrough in the provision  of energy from he  sun for the European  Economic
Community (EEC)  could be  brought forward  by up  the two  decades, if a modest
increase could be provided in the EEC's research effort in this field, according
to the  senior EEC  scientists engaged  in experiments  in solar  energy a EEC's
scientific laboratories at Ispra, near  Milan. The senior West German  scientist
in charge of the  Community's solar energy programme  , Mr. Joachim Gretz,  told
journalists that  at present  levels of  research spending  it was most unlikely
that solar energy  would provide as  much as three  per cent of  the Community's
energy requirements even  after the year  2000. But he  said that with  a modest
increase in the present  sums, devoted by the  EEC to this work  it was possible
that the breakthrough could be achieved by the end of the next decade. Mr. Gratz
calculates that if solar energy only provided three per cent of the EEC's needs,
this could still produce a saving of about a billion pounds in the present  bill
for imported  energy each  year. And  he believes  that with  the possibility of
utilizing more advanced technology in this field it might be possible to satisfy
a much bigger share of the  Community's future energy needs. At present  the EEC
spends about $2.6 millions a year on  solar research at Ispra, one of the  EEC's
official joint  research centres,  and another  $3 millions  a year  in indirect
research with universities and other independent bodies.


26. The phrase "be brought forward" (Lie 2, Para. 1)most probably means "______"

A)be expected B)be completed C)be advanced D)be introduced


27.Some  scientists believe  that a  breakthrough in  the use  of solar  energy
depends on _____.

A)sufficient  funding  B)further  experiments  C)  advanced  technology   D)well
-equipped laboratories


28. According to Mr. Gretz, the present sum of money will enable the  scientists
to provide ______.

A)more than 3%  of the EEC's  needs after the  year 2000 B)only  3% of the EEC's
needs before the year 2000  C) lees than 3% of  the EEC's needs before the  year
2000 D)3% of the EEC's needs after the year 2000


29. Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?

A)The EEC  spends one  billion pounds  on imported  energy each  year. B)At  the
present level  of research  spending, it  is difficult  to make  any significant
progress in the provision of energy from  the sun. C) lees than 3% of  the EEC's
needs before the year 2000. D)3% of the EEC's needs after the year2000.


30. The application of advanced technology to research in solar energy ______.

A)would lead to a big increase  in research funding B)would make it  unnecessary
to import oil C)would  make it possible to  meet the future energy  needs of the
EEC D)would provide a much  greater proportion of the Community's  future energy
needs

Passage Three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:

Just seven years  age, the Jarvik-7  artificial heart was  being cheered as  the
model of human  　 creativeness. The  sight of Barney  Clark-alive and conscious
after trading his diseased heart for  a metal -and -plastic pump -convinced  the
press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't .After
monitoring production of the Jarvik-7 , and reviewing its effects on the 150  or
so patients (most of whom got the  device as a temporary measure) the U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration  concluded that the  machine was doing  more to endanger
lives than to save  them. Last week the  agency cancelled its earlier  approval,
effectively banning the device. The recall  may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of  the
Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with
the banned model  is that the  tubes connecting it  to an external  power source
created a passage for infection . Inventors are now working on new devices  that
would be fully placed, along with a tiny power pack, in the patient's chest. The
first sample  products aren't  expected for  another 10  or 20  years. But  some
people are already worrying that  they'll work -and that America's  overextended
health-care programs  will lose  a precious  $2.5 billion  to $5  billion a year
providing them  for a  relatively few  dying patients.  If such expenditures cut
into funding for more basic care, the net effect could actually be a decline  in
the nation's health.

31. According to the passage the Jarvik-7 artificial heart proved to be _______.

A)a technical failure  B)a technical wonder  C)a good life-saver  D)an effective
means to treat heart disease


32.From the passage we  know that Symbion Inc.  _____. A)has been banned  by the
government  from  producing  artificial  hearts  B)will  review  the  effects of
artificial hearts  before designing  new models  C)may continue  to work  on new
models of reliable artificial hearts D)can make new models of artificial  hearts
available on the market in 10 to 20 years


33.The new models of artificial hearts are expected ______.

A) to have a working life of 10 or 20 years B) to be set fully in the  patient's
chest C) to be equipped with an external power source D) to create a new passage
for infection


34.The word "them" in Line 7, Para. 2 refers to _______.

A)doctors who  treat heart  diseases B)makers  of artificial  hearts C)America's
health - care programs D)new models of artificial hearts


35.Some people feel that _______.

A)artificial hearts are seldom effective B)the country should not spend so  much
money  on  artificial hearts  C)the  country is  not  spending enough  money  on
artificial hearts D)America's health-care programs are not doing enough for  the
nation's health

Passage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:

A rapid means of long-distance transportation became a necessity for the  United
States  as  settlement  spread  ever farther  westward.  The  early  trains were
impractical curiosities,  and for  a long  time the  railroad companies met with
troublesome mechanical problems. The most serious ones were the construction  of
rails able to bear the load,  and the development of a safe,  effective stopping
system. Once these were solved, the  railroad was established as the best  means
of  land transportation.  By 1860  there were  thousands of  miles of  railroads
crossing the eastern mountain ranges  and reaching westward to the  Mississippi.
There were also regional southern and western lines. The high point in  railroad
building came  with the  construction of  the first  transcontinental system. In
1862 Congress  authorized two  western railroad  companies to  build lines  from
Nebraska westward  and from  California eastward  to a  meeting point,  so as to
complete  a transcontinental  crossing linking  the Atlantic  seaboard with  the
Pacific. The  Government helped  the railroads  generously with  money and land.
Actual work on this project began four years later. The Central Pacific  Company
, starting from California, used Chinese labor, while the Union Pacific employed
crews of Irish laborers .The two groups worked at remarkable speed, each  trying
to cover a greater distance than the  other. In 1869 they met at a  place called
Promontory in what is now the state  of Utah , Many visitors came there  for the
great  occasion. There  were joyous  celebrations all  over the  country ,  with
parades and  the ringing  of church  bells to  honor the  great achievement. The
railroad was  very important  in encouraging  westward movement.  It also helped
build  up industry  and farming  by moving  raw materials  and by  distributing
products rapidly to distant markets. In linking towns and people to one  another
it helped unify the United States.


36.The major problems with America's railroad system in the mid 19th century lay
in ______.

A)poor quality rails and unreliable stopping systems B)lack of financial support
for development C)limited railroad lines D)lack of a transcontinental railroad


37. The building of the first transcontinental system _________. A)brought about
a rapid growth of industry and farming in the west B)attracted many visitors  to
the construction sites C)attracted  laborers from Europe D)encouraged  people to
travel all over the country


38.  The best  title for  this passage  would be  _______. A)Settlements  Spread
Westward  B)The  Coast-to  -Coast Railroad:  A  Vital  Link C)American  Railroad
History D)The Importance of Trains in the American Economy


39.The construction of the transcontinental railroad took ______. A)9 years  B)7
years C)4 years D)3 years


40 . What most likely made people think about a transcontinental railroad?

A) The possibility of government support for such a task. B) The need to explore
Utah. C) The need to connect the east coast with the west. D)The need to develop
the railroad industry in the west.
