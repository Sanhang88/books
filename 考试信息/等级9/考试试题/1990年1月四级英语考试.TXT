You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single ling through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:

Oceanography has been defined as "The application of all sciences to the study of the sea". Before the nineteenth century, scientists with an interest in the sea were few and far between.
Certainly Newton considered some theoretical aspects of it in his writings, but he was reluctant to go to sea to further his work.
For most people the sea was remote, and with the exception of early intercontinental travellers or others who earned a living from the sea, there was little reason to ask many questions about it , let alone to ask what lay beneath the surface. The first time that the question "what is at the bottom of the oceans?" had to be answered with any commercial consequence was when the laying of a telegraph cable from Europe to America was proposed. The engineers had to know the depth profile of the route to estimate the length of cable that had to be manufactured.
It was to Maury of the US Navy that the Atlantic Telegraph Company turned, in 1853, for information on this matter. In the 1840s, Maury had been responsible for encouraging voyages during which soundingswere taken to investigate the depths of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Later , some of his findings aroused much popular interest in his book The Physical Geography of the Sea.
The cable was laid, but not until 1866 was the connection made permanent and reliable. At the early attempts, the cable failed and when it was taken out for repairs it was found to be covered in living growths, a fact which defied contemporary scientific opinion that there was no life in the deeper parts of the sea.Within a few years oceanography was under way. In 1872 Thomson led a scientific expedition , whichlasted for four years and brought home thousands of samples from the sea. Their classification and analysis occupied scientists for years and led to a five-volume report, the last volume being published in 1895.

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:

Normally a student must attend a certain number of courses in order to graduate, and each course which he attends gives him a credit which he may count towards a degree, In many American universities the total work for a degree consists of thirty-six courses each lasting for one semester. A typical course consists of three classes per week for fifteen weeks; while attending a university a student will probably attend four or five courses during each semester. Normally a student . would expect to take four years attending two semesters each year. It is possible to spread the period of work for the degree over a longer period. It is also possible for a student to move between one university and another during his degree course, though this is not in fact done as a regular practice.
For very course that the follows a students is given a grade, which is recorded, and the record is available for the student to show to prospective employers. All this imposes a constant pressure and strain of work , but in spite of this some students still find time for great activity in student affairs. Elections to positions in student organisations arouse much enthusiasm. The effective work of maintaining discipline is usually performed by students who advise the academic authorities. Any student who is thought to have broken the rules, for example, by cheating his to appear before a student court, With the enormous numbers of students, the operation of the system does involve a certain amount of activity. A student who has held one of these positions of authority is much respected and it will be of benefit to him later in his career.

Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:

Do you find getting up in the morning so difficult that it's painful ? This might be called laziness, butDr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle.
During the hours when you labour through your work you may say that you're "hot". That's true. Thetime of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of bady temperature is at its peak . For somepeople the peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening No one hasdiscovered why this is so , but it leads to such familiar monologues as : "Get up, John! You'll be late forwork again !" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature-and -energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean,and which cycle each member of the family has.
You can't change your energy cycle, but you can learn to make your life fit it better. Habit can help,Dr. Kleitman believes . Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway . Counteract your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to .If your energy is low in the morningbut you have an important job to do early in the day, rise before your usual hour. This won't change your cycle, but you'll get up steam and work better at your low point.
Get off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a leisurely yawn and stretch . Sit on the edgeof the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor . Avoid the troublesome search for clean clothes bylaying them out the night before. Whenever possible, do routine work in the afternoon and save tasks requiringmore energy or concentration for your sharper hours.


31. If a person finds getting up early a problem , most probably _______.

A)he is a lazy person
B)he refuses to follow his own energy cycle
C)he is not sure when his energy is low
D)he is at his peak in the afternoon or evening


32. Which of the following may lead to family quarrels according to the passage?

A) Unawareness of energy cycles.
B) Familiar monologues.
C) A change in a family member's energy cycle.
D) Attempts to control the energy cycle of other family members.


33.If one wants to work more efficiently at his how point in the morning, he should _____.

A)change his energy cycle
B)overcome his laziness
C)get up earlier than usual
D)go to bed earlier

C)Habit helps a person adapt to his own energy cycle.

 Passage Four
 Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:

We find that bright children are rarely held back by mixed-ability teaching. On the contrary, both theirknowledge and experience are enriched. We feel that there are many disadvantages in streaming pupils. It does not take into account the fact that children develop at different rates. It can have a bad effect on both the bright and the not-so-bright child. After all, it can be quite discouraging to be at the bottom of the top grade!
Besides, it is rather unreal to grade people just according to their intellectual ability. This is only one aspect of their total personality. We are concerned to develop the abilities of all our pupils to the full, not just their academic ability. We also value personal qualities and social skills, and we find that mixed-ability teaching contributes to all these aspects of learning.
In our classrooms, we work in various ways. The pupils often work in groups: this gives them the opportunity to learn to co-operate, to share, and to develop leadership skills. They also learn how to copewith personal problems as well as learning how to think, to make decisions, to analyse and evaluate, and to communicate effectively. The pupils learn from each other as well as from the teacher.
Sometimes the pupils work in pairs; sometimes they work on individual tasks and assignments, and they can do this at their own speed. They also have some formal class teaching when this is appropriate. We encourage our pupils to use the library , and we teach them the skills they need in order to do this efficiently . An advanced pupil can do advanced work: it does not matter what age the child is . We expect our pupils to do their best, not their least , and we give them every encouragement to attain this goal.


36. In the passage the author's attitude towards "mixed-ability teaching" is _______.

A)critical
B)questioning
C)approving
D)objective


37. By "held back" (Line 1) the author means "____________".

A)made to remain in the same classes
B)forced to study in the lower classes
C)drawn to their studies
D)prevented from advancing


38. The author argues that a teacher's chief concern should be the development of the student's _______.

A)personal qualities and social skills
B)total personality
C)learning ability and communicative skills
D)intellectual ability


39. Which of the following is NOT MENTIONED in the third paragraph ?

A)Group work gives pupils the opportunity to learn to work together with others.
B)Pupils also learn to develop their reasoning abilities.
C)Group work provides pupils with the opportunity to learn to be capable organizers.
D)Pupils also learn how to participate in teaching activities.


40. The author's purpose in writing this passage is to _________.

A)argue for teaching bright and not-so0bright pupils in the same class
B)recommend pair work and group work for classroom activities
C)offer advice on the proper use of the library
D)emphasize the importance of appropriate formal classroom teaching
