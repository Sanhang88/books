Passage 1

As they drove to the theatre that evening, the fog got worse and worse. The traffic slowed down to a walking pace and almost stopped. When they eventually got to the theatre, the ballet was over. Mrs. Lester could not work out ho w it had taken them so long to get there, even taking the fog into account. The theatre was within walking distance of their house.

Passage 2
   The motor vehicle has killed and disabled more people in its brief history than any bomb or weapon ever invented. Much of the blood on the street flows essentially from uncivil behavior of drivers who refuse to respect the legal and moral rights of others. So the massacre on the road may be regarded as a social problem .
   In fact, the enemies of society on wheels are rather harmless people just ordinary people acting carelessly, you might say. But it is a principle both of law an d common morality that carelessness is no excuse when one's actions could bring death or damage to others. A minority of the killers go even beyond carelessness to total negligence.
   Researchers have estimated that as many as 80 per cent of all automobile accidents can be attributed to the psychological condition of the driver. Emotional upsets can distort drivers' reactions, slow their judgement, and blind them to dangers that might otherwise be evident. The experts warn that it is vital for every driver to make a conscious effort to keep one's emotions under control.
   Yet the irresponsibility that accounts for much of the problem is not confined t o drivers. Street walkers regularly violate traffic regulations, they are at fault in most vehicle walker accidents; and many cyclists even believe that they are not subject to the basic rules of the road.
   Significant legal advances have been made towards safer driving in the past few years. Safety standards for vehicle have been raised both at the point of manufacture and through periodic road-worthiness inspections. In addition, speed limit s have been lowered. Due to these measures, the accident rate has decreased. But the accident experts still worry because there has been little or no improvement in the way drivers behave. The only real and lasting solution, say the experts , is to convince people that driving is a skilled task requiring constant care and concentration. Those who fail to do all these things present a threat to those with whom they share the road.

16. What is the author's main purpose in writing the passage?
A.  To show that the motor vehicle is a very dangerous invention.
B.  To promote understanding between careless drivers and street walkers.
C.  To discuss traffic problems and propose possible solutions.
D.  To warn drivers of the importance of safe driving.

17. According to the passage, traffic accidents may be regarded as a social problem because _____.
A.  autos have become most destructive to mankind
B.  people usually pay little attention to law and morality
C.  civilization brings much harm to people
D.  the lack of virtue is becoming more severe

18. Why does the author mention the psychological condition of the driver i n Paragraph Three?
A.  To give an example of the various reasons for road accidents.
B.  To show how important it is for drivers to be emotionally healthy.
C.  To show some of the inaccurate estimations by researchers.
D.  To illustrate the hidden tensions in the course of driving.

19. Who are NOT mentioned as being responsible for the road accidents?
A.  Careless bicycle-riders.
B.  Mindless people walking in the street.
C.  Irresponsible drivers.

Passage 3
   In the early days of nuclear power, the United States made money on it. But today opponents have so complicated its development that no nuclear plants have been ordered or built here in 12 years.
   The greatest fear of nuclear power opponents has always been a reactor "melt down ". Today, the chances of a meltdown that would threaten U.S. public health are testing new reactors that rely not on human judgment to shut them down but on the laws of nature. Now General Electric is already building two advanced reactors in Japan. But don't expect them even on U.S. shores unless things change in Washington.
   The procedure for licensing nuclear power plants is a bad dream. Any time during , or even after, construction, an objection by any group or individual can bring everything to a halt while the matter is investigated or taken to court. Meanwhile, the builder must add nice, but not necessary improvements, some of which force him to knock down walls and start over. In every case when a plant has been opposed, the Nuclear Regulation Commission has ultimately granted a license to construct or operate. But the victory often costs so much that the utility ends up abandoning the plant anyway.
   A case in point is the Shoreham plant on New York's Long Island. Shoreham was a virtual twin to the Millstone plant in Connecticut, both ordered in the mid 60s ' . Millstone, complete for $ 101 million, has been generating electricity for two decades. Shoreham, however, was singled out by antinuclear activists who, by sending in endless protests, drove the cost over $ 5 billion and delayed its use f or many years.
   Shoreham finally won its operation license. But the plant has never produced a watt power. Governor Mario Cuomo, an opponent of a Shoreharn startup, used his power to force New York's publicities commission to accept the following settlement: the power company could pass the cost of Shoreham along to its consumers only if it agreed not to operate the plant. Today, a perfectly good facility, capable of servicing hundreds of thousands of homes, sits rusting.

21. The author's attitude towards the development of nuclear power is _____.
A. negative   B. neutral   C. positive     D. questioning

22. What has made the procedure for licensing nuclear plants a bad dream?
A. The inefficiency of the Nuclear Regulation Commission.
B. The enormous cost of construction and operation.
C. The length of time it takes to make investigations.
D. The objection of the opponents of nuclear power.

23. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that _____.
A. there are not enough safety measures in the U.S. for running new nuclear power plants
B. it is not technical difficulties that prevent the building of nuclear power  plants in the U.S.
C. there are already more nuclear power plants than necessary in the U.S.
D. the American government will not allow Japanese nuclear reactors to be       installed in the U.S.
24. Governor Mario Cuomo's chief intention in proposing the settlement wa s to _____.
A. stop the Shoreham plant from going into operation
B. urge the power company to further increase its power supply
C. permit the Shoreham plant to operate under certain conditions
D. help the power company to solve its financial problems

25. From which sentence of the article can you see the attitude of the author and  that of Govenor Mario Cuomo respectively?
A. the 2nd sentence in the first paragraph, the 3rd sentence in the last paragraph.
B. the last sentence, the last sentence but one
C. the last sentence in para.2, last sentence but one.
D. the last sentence in para.3, the 3rd sentence in the fifth paragraph.

Passage 4
   Does a bee know what is going on in its mind when it navigates its way to distant food sources and back to the hive (蜂房), using polarized sunlight and the tin y magnet it carries as a navigational aid? Or is the bee just a machine, unable to do its mathematics and dance its language in any other way? To use Dondald Griffin's term, does a bee have "awareness", or to use a phrase I like better, c an a bee think and imagine?
   There is an experiment for this, or at least an observation, made long ago by Karl von Firsch and more recently confirmed by James Gould in Princeton. Biologist s who wish to study such things as bee navigation, language, and behavior in general have to train their bees to fly from the hive to one or another special place. To do this, they begin by placing a source of sugar very close to the hive s o that the bees (considered by their trainers to be very dumb beasts) can learn w hat the game is about. Then, at regular interval, the dish or whatever is moved progressively farther and farther from the hive, in increments (增加量) of about 25 percent at each move. Eventually, the target is being moved 100 feet or more at a jump, very far from the hive. Sooner or later, while this process is going on, the biologist shifting the dish of sugar will find the bees are out there waiting for them, precisely where the next position had been planned. This is an uncomfortable observation to make.

26. The best title for the passage is _____.
A. Teaching the Bees to Navigate
B. Testing the Awareness of Bees
C. Navigational Techniques of Bees
D. Behaviorists Versus Biologists: A Zoological Debate

27. The word "awareness" in paragraph 1 appears in quotation marks in order to _____.
A. show the author's preference for the term
B. indicate that it is being used humorously
C. acknowledge Donald Griffin's previous use of the term
D. point out that it was used differently earlier in the passage

28. In the second paragraph Karl von Frischis mentioned _____.
A. to introduce his observation on bee behavior
B. to contrast his theories with those of James Gould
C. acknowledge Donald Griffin's previous use of the term
D. point out that it was used differently earlier in the passage

29. According to the author, sugar was used in the study _____.
A. to reward the bees for performing the experiment correctly
B. to train the bees to travel to a particular place
C. to ensure that the bees knew where the hive was
D. to ensure that the bees would obey the orders

30. The result of the experiment explained in the passage seems to indicate that _____.
A. research using bees is too dangerous to be conducted successfully
B. bees are unable to navigate beyond 100 feet their hive
C. scientists can teach bees to navigate
D. bees are able to perform limited reasoning tasks
