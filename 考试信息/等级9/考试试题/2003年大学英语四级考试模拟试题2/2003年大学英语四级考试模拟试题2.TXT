2003年大学英语四级考试模拟试题2
Questions 56to 60are based on the following passage：
This year，GEC（General Electric Company），the country's largest electrical and electronics group with 130firms，has 1，400 vacancies for graduates．"These people are our lifeblood，"says Mr．Michael Bett，the company's chief personnel officer．"At the moment the demand is particularly high because we are a big，growing，successful company；but even in times of recession（衰退）we have taken more rather than fewer graduates．Of this year's persons accepted，42 percent-by far the largest number-will be electronic engineers，but wealso want mechanical engineers，production engineers and，of course，electrical engineers． There is always some confusion about the difference between electrical and electronic engineering，partly explained by the fact that the two are not completely different．The Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers says that， without going into detail，electrical engineering is concerned with the use of electricity to produce heat，light，and mechanical power； whereas electronic engineering is concerned with its other applications，namely communications（telephone，radio，recording and TV）， location and navigation（radar and microwave）， instrumentation and control（from factories to spacecraft，computer engineering，and medical electronics）．However，the electrical engineers， who also have their own satellite communication，and the whole field of computers and automation，including medical electronics．It would certainly make matters simpler if the two professional bodies were to become one．But the important thing is，of course，the work that the engineers do．Mr．Bett says，"I don't think we at GEC sit around worrying about the qualifications of our engineers．It's the job they're doing that's important．"
"We have two types of graduate entry， direct and training．Direct means that they go straight on to a job，whereas people in training positions are helped to develop themselves in the context of a job．Now whether they want to become a fully qualified member of their insti- tutions or not is really up to them．We are really much more concerned as to whether they are effective employees．"
It is said that to be effective you must choose the type of employment that best suits your skills and abilities．And electronic and electrical engineers are especially fortunate in the wide range of available work．You do not have to be a graduate．
In general terms，those with practical skills will find the widest range of opportunities in manufacture，repair and serving work，and they should train as technicians． The greatest intellectual challenge，where the graduate is needed，is in the fields of design， development and research．

Questions 61to 65are based on the following passage：
Time was playing tricks，my attention had its lulls（暂停），it might have been minutes before a hand was pulling my jacket aside， something cold，glass，metal against the skin．
"What are you doing now？"I broke out again．
"Another test，that's all．"Mansel's voice didn't alter．"I've got to know．I'm not going on like this．"
Fingers were fixing apparatus on my chest．
"What's gone wrong？"Again，that didn't sound like my own voice．"I've got to know what's wrong．"
Clicks and whirrs（呼呼声）from some machine．My hearing had become preternatu- rally acute（敏锐的）and I could hear Mansel and Margaret whispering together．
"Shall I tell him？"Mansel was asking．
"You'd better．He's noticed everything．"
There was movement by the side of my bed，and Mansel，instead of Margaret，was speaking clearly into my ear．
"There's nothing to worry about now．But your heart stopped．"
The words were spaced out，distinct．They didn't carry much meaning．I said dully"Oh"．
I gathered that it had happened in the middle of the operation．
I asked："How long for？"
"Between three-and-a-half and three-and- three-quarter minutes．"
I thought later that when Mansel told me the truth，he told the truth．
"We got it going again，"Mansel's voice was cheerful．"There s a bit of a cut under your ribs．You're fine now．"
He was at pains to assure me that the eye operation had been completed．It was time，he said，for him to let my wife talk to me．
Replacing Mansel's voice was Margaret's， steady and warm．"Now you know．"
I said，"Yes，I know．"I added，"I brought you back no news from the other world．"
Margaret went on talking，making plans for a fortnight ahead，saying there would be plenty of time to argue about theology（神学）． She sounded calm，ready to laugh：she was concealing from me that she was in a state of shock．

Questions 66to 70are based on the following passage：
Our modern society cannot do without books．A handbook is not born in one day．It takes months and months，sometimes years，before an author can buy his own book in the bookshops．
First，the author writes or composes his manuscript．He makes a draft and then works the draft out．This can take years．When the draft-copy is finished，the author types it，or asks somebody else to type it for him，because the manuscript has to be neat and easy to read．
When the typing is finished，the author takes his manuscript to an editor．The editor reads the manuscript or gives it to a reading-board．If the manuscript（手稿）is good，then the editor decides to publish it．He takes the manuscript to the publisher who is the man with money．It's the publisher who pays for the printing or the publication of the manuscript．
When the manuscript is in the printer's hands，the first thing to do is to makea lay-out．This lay-out is a draft composition of the book．On the lay-out，the printer indicated the text area，the type of letters to use，the space for eventual illustrations，etc．
Then he sends this lay-out to the author． The author，together with the editor，gives his advice，corrects eventual mistakes and sends the lay-out back to the printer．
The printer now prints the first sample-pages to show them to the author and the editor．If the sample-pages turn out to be excellent，the definitive printing-process starts．
First the text is composed on paper and sent to the author for the last and definitive correction．Then the printer makes a photograph of each page，develops them and prints them on aluminum（铝）plates．The text and the illustrations are now visible on the enormous plates．On one such a plate，there are sometimes as many as 16pages of the book．
This plate is then put on the printing-machine，and the text is printed on enormous sheets of paper，16 times the size of the book．
If colors are used，then each page must be reprinted for each color because we can only print one color at the time．These sheets are then folded and bound together by means of a strong rope．
Then they are glued，covered and put between a clamp．When the books are dry，their edges are cut straight and smooth．Now the book is finished．The printer sends the copies to the publisher who can sell them to bookshops， schools，or individual readers．
That is also the story of the books you are holding in your hands now and of all the books you have been and will read．
66．This passage is mainly about _______ ．
    A）how an author writes his manuscript
    B）how a book is born
    C）how a lay-out is made
    D）how the first sample-pages is printed
67．Which of the following is closest in meaning to the word"lay-out"（Line 3，Para．3）？
    A）Design of a book．
    B）Draft of a book．
    C）Arrangement of pictures．
    D）Arrangement of letters．
68．A book is a（n） _______．
    A）jewel of beauty
    B）treasure of intellect and beauty
    C）expensive thing
    D）history record
69．Which of the following is true？

    B）The photographs of the composed pages are developed on aluminum plates．
    C）The photographs of the composed pages are developed and printed on paper．
    D）The photographs of the composed pages are printed on aluminum plates．

Have you ever watched a spider making its web？Slowly it goes around in a place like the dark corner of a room．And as it moves，a small thread drops from the spider's body．For hours-sometimes even days-the spider works on its web．Round and round the spider goes， leaving that soft thread behind．If the thread breaks，the spider starts again with a new thread．

79    ．He wanted to think of a new way to
80    the war and save his country．In his cave he saw a strange shadow on the wall． There，in the
81    of a candle，he saw a spider
82  a web．The spider did its work with great care．It was trying to make a good web．
The king could not take his eyes
83  the spider's web．And as he watched he thought of his own troubles．The spider's thread broke， and it
84  King Robert laugh．"Now all your work is
85 ，"he said．"You'll have to begin again．"
The spider began its work on a new web．Soon the thread broke
86．The work on another web began just as fast．The king saw the spider's thread
87   six times．
The king felt sorry for the little spider．He smiled
88  the spider and said，"You，too， are a
89．Every time you start a new thread，it breaks．And every time I fight a new
90，my soldiers lose．What shall we do？" Inside the cave everything was quiet．But King Robert received an answer to his question．He saw the spider try a seventh time to finish its web．The King of Scotland did the same thing．Quickly he made a new battle plan．Then he led his men in a great fight that won the war for his country．

Coaching Suggestions
The coach should know his job and do what he can to be certain that the players respect notonly his ability to coach but his quality as a man．He should inspire confidence so that the players will exert their full effort in trying to execute his every suggestion．
The coach should have patience．One of the most common faults in coaching is to expect too much of the players．There is a tendency for many coaches who were great players themselves to expect their players to move along as fast as they did．Give the players a chance to practice and develop physically and mentally．
The coach should maintain an open mind to suggestions from his players ifaplayer has suggested aplay，I feelitiswise to give him creditfor itin frontofthe entire team．
Since the coach can play a major role in the development of a player，being a good coach is very important．
