Part III Reading Comprehension（35 minutes）
Directions：There are four passages in this part． Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements．For each of them there are four choices marked A），B），C）and D）．You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center．
Questions 51to 55are based on the following passage：
What lovely weather Britain has been having．The average temperature for the first two weeks of April（1994）has soared to around 14°C，well above the long-term average of 8°C． And it has been pretty dry，too．Although the Meteorological Office has forecast above-aver-
age rainfall for southern England during April， no big black clouds have appeared yet．This is all very well for the sun-bathers，but if it continues warm and sunny-as it did last year- dwindling（减少的）water resources could mean rationing（定量供应）by the end of the summer．The ten new regional water authorities are sensibly planning their strategy．
Rationing should be necessary only if rainfall over the next few months is significantly below average．The first two months of the year were exceptionally wet．February was the wettest since 1986，and January and February together were the wettest since 1968． It was just as well．Last year was so dry that many underground reservoirs-known as Aquifers，which store most of the water supplies in many parts of the country-practically dried up．East Anglia was particularly badly hit．It gets 60％of its water needs from Aquifers．Now there is a scheme to feedwater from the wet northwest，via the Seven and the Thames，to the dry areas of south Essex．
This time last year it had been so dry that the National Water Council called for an emergency report from river boards and local water authorities．It looked as if the country would be practically dry by the autumn．In fact，rainfall increased during the summer，and although this was not sufficient to raise the water table much．In Devon，two-thirds of the available water is stored in small surface reser- voirs．With evaporation，long periods of drought can cause trouble，even after heavy rain．But the southwest should be all right this year；so far it has been exceptionally wet．
The rest of the country has been wet，too． Scotland，which had very low rainfall in the three years to last November，has had record falls since then．Reservoirs are still well stocked throughout the north but are drying out fast． The Midlands is full stocked．In the southeast， January and February were wet，but March was too dry for comfort and so far April has been， too．The Greater London Area takes three quarters of its needs from the Thames above Teddington．Even when the flow-rate sank to miserable levels last year，London's enormous resources could cope．The surface reservoirs carry about 37billion gallons of water，enough to keep London at full consumption for 92 consecutive days．Last year，even after the drought，the reservoirs only fell to 35billions gallons．So there is no need for panic yet．
51．Which of the following is not mentioned in the first paragraph？
    A）It was warm and sunny during April in Britain（1993）．
    B）It didn't rain during April in southern England（1994）．
    C）Water resources could become less if the lovely weather lasted long．
    D）Many water authorities had already found good ways to supply water．
52．What would be the best title for this passage？
    A）Unusual Weather during April in Britain
    B）Inaccurate Weather Forecasts
    C）Dwindling Water Resources
    D）Necessary Rationing of Water
53．From the passage we know that _______ ．
    A）rationing would be necessary if rainfall is much less than the usual amount
    B）the first two months of 1993were the wettest
    C）many underground reservoirs could store the water needed by people all over the country
    D）the Seven and the Thames began to supply enough water for the dry areas
54．The first two months of this year were _______ ．
    A）just wet enough to fill the Aquifers
    B）fortunately extremely wet
    C）exceptionally wet，as were the same months in 1968
    D）the wettest ever
55．Last year the River Thames _______ ．
    A）was very unhappy
    B）was very fast
    C）had much less water in it than usual
    D）caused unhappiness becau2003年大学英语四级考试模拟试题（五）
