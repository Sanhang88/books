Part II Reading Comprehension（35 minutes）
Directions：There are four passages in this part．Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements．For each of them there are four choices marked A），B），C）and D）． You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the ANSWER SHEET with a single line through the center．
Questions 21to 25are based on the following passage：
More attention was paid to the quality of production in France at the time of Rene Coty．Charles Deschanel was then the financial minister．He stressed that workmanship and quality were more important than quantity for industrial production．It would be necessary to produce quality goods for the international market to compete with those produced in other countries．The French economy needed a larger share of the international market to balance its import and export trade．
French industrial and agricultural production was still inadequate to meet the immediate needs of the people，let alone long-ranged developments．Essential imports had stretched the national credit to the breaking point．Rents were tightly controlled，but the extreme inflation affected general population most severely through the cost of food．Food costs took as much as 80 percent of the workers'income．Wages，it is true，had risen．Extensive family allowances and benefits were paid by the state，and there was full-time and overtime employment．Taken together，these factors enabled the working class to exist but allowed them no sense of security．In this precarious（不稳定的）and discouraging situation，workmen were willing to work overseas for higher wages．
The government was reluctant to let workers leave the country．It was feared this immigration of workers would deplete the labor force．The lack of qualified workers might hinder the improvement in the quality of industrial products produced．Qualified workers employed abroad would only increase the quantity of quality goods produced in foreign countries．Also the quantity of quality goods produced in France would not be able to increase as part of its qualified labor force moved to other countries．
21．According to the passage，the French workers were ________ ．
    A）better paid than the workers in any other European countries
    B）able to save more money with the increase in their wages
    C）anxious to work abroad
    D）often unable to find work in France

    A）better quality in production
    B）increasing quantity in production
    C）having the government raise tariffs on foreign imports
    D）eliminating unions in France
23．The French government was reluctant to let the workers leave the country because ________ ．
    A）it would enlarge the working force
    B）it would hinder the improvement of quality in industrial production
    C）it would hinder the increase in quantity of exports
    D）it would damage the imports
24．Rents in France ________．
    A）were extremely high
    B）were extremely controlled
    C）took as much as 80percent of the workers'income
    D）had doubled in two years
25．According to the passage，the French government ________．
    A）prohibited French to work abroad
    B）reduced taxes to fight inflation
    C）paid family allowances and benefits
    D）prohibited the French workers to join labor unions
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage：
Food can be divided into two basic categories：real food and pleasure food．Real food is fuel for the body's needs，while pleasure food， which is high in fat and sugar，is primarily for taste satisfaction．The categories are pretty obvious．Broccoli is real food．Cookies are in the pleasure group．
When you are hungry，you are faced with choices．If you aren't suffering from excessive hunger，you can be rational about them．Go to the refrigerator．What looks good？If you have chosen a real food，say，a turkey sandwich，you can be certain your body can use it for fuel．Eat it and enjoy．
Two hours later you are hungry again．Back to the refrigerator．What looks good？Ice cream．Stop！Employ your will power just a little．Ice cream is not what your body needs．Does something else look good？Yes，a piece of toast with peanut butter and a glass of milk sound good too．Okay，go ahead，remembering that high-fat real foods should be eaten in moderation．
One trick is to eliminate pleasure foods from your kitchen．Instead，keep a variety of high-quality foods available at all times．In short，buy lots of delicious real food，food you really like，and get rid o2003年大学英语四级考试模拟试题（四）

Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage：
Food can be divided into two basic categories：real food and pleasure food．Real food is fuel for the body's needs，while pleasure food， which is high in fat and sugar，is primarily for taste satisfaction．The categories are pretty obvious．Broccoli is real food．Cookies are in the pleasure group．
When you are hungry，you are faced with choices．If you aren't suffering from excessive hunger，you can be rational about them．Go to the refrigerator．What looks good？If you have chosen a real food，say，a turkey sandwich，you can be certain your body can use it for fuel．Eat it and enjoy．
Two hours later you are hungry again．Back to the refrigerator．What looks good？Ice cream．Stop！Employ your will power just a little．Ice cream is not what your body needs．Does something else look good？Yes，a piece of toast with peanut butter and a glass of milk sound good too．Okay，go ahead，remembering that high-fat real foods should be eaten in moderation．
One trick is to eliminate pleasure foods from your kitchen．Instead，keep a variety of high-quality foods available at all times．In short，buy lots of delicious real food，food you really like，and get rid of the junk．
But what if you have ice cream on hand and nothing sounds good？Although you don't want to eat pleasure foods whenever the urge strikes，there is a legitimate place for them in your diet．If you have analyzed your feelings and there are no other needs imitating hunger， eat the ice cream．You have not failed．On the contrary，you have accepted your natural appetite，but not blindly．
Surprisingly，when you know you can eat anything you want，and that you never have to put up with unsatisfied hunger again，it takes a lot of pressure off．You will begin to want to eat what your body needs，and your body will begin to need foods that will lead to slimness．

Questions 31to 35are based on the following passage：
Cloning，manipulating a cell from an animal so that it grows into an exact copy of that animal，is the forbidden fruit of biotechnology． Some scientists were so sure it could not be done that，in the 1970s，they discouraged moralists（伦理学家）from discussing its moral implications．Yet at the same time other scientists，secretly，in out-of-the-way labs，were getting ever closer to making clones．For ten years，scientists have been cloning sheep and cows from embryo（胚胎）cells．But so far Dolly is the only animal cloned from an adult cell，not from an embryo． She is living proof that scientists have solved one of the most challenging problems of cell biology．
The question now is how soon will scientists clone humans．"Nature"，the scientific journal that published the Dolly paper，commented，"Cloning humans from adults tissues is likely to be achievable any time from one to ten years from now．"Most scientists agree there is no insurmountable obstacle in human cloning．But a human clone，even though it might resemble the individual from whom it was made，would differ dramatically in personality and character，intelligence and talents．"You will never get 100 percent identity，"says psychologist Jerome Kagan of Harvard，"because of chance factors and because environments are never exactly the same．"
That，however，is small comfort to many people．Shortly after Dolly's birth announcement，President Clinton ordered a group of experts to come up with proposals for government action．With the cloning of humans within reach，whether it is to be banned or regulated is now on the nation's moral agenda（议事日程）． Some regard the cloning of humans as inherently evil，a morally unjustifiable intrusion into human life．They measure the morality of any act by the intention behind it；still others are concerned primarily with consequences for society as well as for individuals．
For the moment it seems that the latest achievement in the biotech field has provided everyone with food for thought．
31．In what way is Dolly different from earlier clones？
    A）It is cloned from human embryo．
    B）It is cloned from a human cell．
    C）It is cloned from an adult cell．
    D）It is cloned from an adult embryo．
32．What is the prospect，according to most scientists，of making clones from adult human tissues？
   A）Such clones will be exactly like the one from whom it was made．
   B）It would be possible within the decade．
   C）There still exist some technical problems．
   D）It is impossible to make such clones in one to ten years from now．
33．Why did Clinton order a group of experts to make proposals for government action？
    A）He wants to quicken the pace of cloning research．
    B）The success of cloning involves serious moral evaluation problems．
    C）He wants to ban the human cloning research．
    D）He is worried about the funding of the further research．
34．"Food for thought"in the last paragraph means ________．
    A）worry for food
    B）increased food to be expected
    C）something worthy of consideration
    D）reasons for deep understanding
35．The best title for the selection can be ________．
    A）BiotechnologicalSuccess And Its Possible Consequences
    B）Dolly Is Only The Beginning
    C）The Definition Of Cloning
    D）Cloning Humans From Adults'Tissues
Questions 36to 40are based on the following passage：
Failure is probably the most fatiguing experience a person ever has．There is nothing more exhausting than not succeeding，being blocked，not moving ahead．It is an evil circle．Failure breeds fatigue，and fatigue makes it harder to get to work，which adds to the fatigue．
We experience this tiredness in two main ways，as start-up fatigue and performance fatigue．In the former case，we keep putting off a task that we are forced to take up．Either because it is too tedious or because it is too difficult，we avoid it．And the longer we postpone it，the more tired we feel．
Such start-up fatigue is very real，even not actually physical，not something in our muscles and bones．The remedy is obvious，though perhaps not easy to apply：willpower exercise．The moment I find myself turning away from a job， or putting it under a pile of things I have to do， I clear my desk of everything else and attach the objectionable item first．To prevent start-up fatigue，always treat the most difficult job first．
Performance fatigue is more difficult to handle．Here we are willing to get started，but we can't seem to do the job right．Its difficulties appear to be insurmountable and however hard we work，we fail again and again．The mounting experience of failure carries with it an ever-increasing burden of mental fatigue．In such a situation，I work as hard as I can，then let the unconscious take over．
36．Which of the following can be called an evil circle？
    A）Success-zeal-success-zeal．
    B）Failure-tiredness-failure-tiredness．
    C）Failure-zeal-failure-tiredness．
    D）Success-exhaustion-success-exhaustion．
37．According to the passage ，when keeping putting off a task，we can experience ________．
    A）tiredness
    B）performance fatigue
    C）start-up fatigue
    D）unconsciousness
38．To overcome start-up fatigue ，we need ________ ．
    A）toughness
    B）prevention
    C）muscles
    D）strong willpower
39．The word"insurmountable"in the last paragraph probably means ________ ．
    A）that can not be solved
    B）that can not be understood
    C）that can not be imagined
    D）that can not be objected
40．According to the passage，which of the following statements is NOT true？
    A）It is easier to overcome start-up fatigue．
    B）Performance fatigue occurs when the job we are willing to take gets blocked．
    C）One will finally succeed after experiencing the evil circle．
    D）Fatigue often accompanies fatigue．

Part IV Short Answer Questions（15 minutes）
Directions：In this part，there is a short passage with five questions or incomplete statements．
Read the passage carefully．Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words．
In an effort to produce the largest，fastest， the most luxurious ship afloat，the British built the Titanic．It was so superior to anything else on the seas that it was considered"unsinkable"． So sure of this were the owners that they provided lifeboats for only 950of its possible 3，500 passengers．Many passengers were aboard the night it rammed an ice-burg，only two days at sea and more than half way between England and New York，the destination．Because the luxury liner was traveling so fast，it was impossible to avoid the ghostly looking ice-burg．An inextinguishable fire also contributed to the ship's disaster．Panic increased the number of deaths as people jumped into the icy water or fought to be among the few to board the lifeboats．Four hours after the mishap，another ship，the Carpathia，rescued the survivors，less than a third of those originally aboard．The famous Titanic enjoyed only two days of sailing glory on its maiden voyage in 1912before plunging into 12，000feet of water near the coast of Newfoundland，where it lies today．

Passage One
What is the sky？Where is it？How high is it？What lies above the sky？I am sure that you have asked these questions．They are very difficult to answer，aren't they？
If someone asked you："What color is the sky？"I expect that you would answer："Blue．"I am afraid that you would be wrong．The sky has no color．When we see blue，we are looking at blue sunlight．The sunlight is shining on little bits of dust in the air．
Is the sky full of air？I am sure you have asked this question，too．We know that there is air all around the world．We could not breathe without air．Airplanes could not fly without air．They need air to lift their wings．Airplanes cannot fly very high because as they go higher，the air gets thinner．If we go far enough away from the earth，we find there is no air．
Perhaps we can answer some of our questions now． What is the sky？Nothing．Where is it？It is all around the world．The sky isspace．In thisspace there isnothing except the sun，the moon and allthe stars．
Questions 11to 13are based on the passage you have just heard．

12．Why can't airplanes fly without air？
13．What willhappen to us ifwe go far enough from the earth？
Passage Two
There are so many things going on in our modern lives，and change happens so quickly．It is hard to imagine a time when things were slower and you could really see a new thing come into your life and to remember the day or the year when those things happened． I know that today，for example，there are many instances of second and third generations of things，such as televisions or radios，when some of us were not even aware that there was a first generation．
A friend of mine was born at the end of the last century，and talking to her，I really got asense of her being a living history book，of being able to talk about the changes in her own life and to know that these changes were really the changes that society was going through．
She gets really excited，for example，when she talks aboutthe firsttime she ever saw acamera，and even more excited when she saw herself in the picture that the photographer took．She lived in asmalltown，and at the time thatshe wasvery young，there were no cars or trains in her town at all．As she grew up，cars and trains came in，and she remembers her first ride with a real sense of amazement that anyone could move so fast．
Questions 14to 16are based on the passage you have just heard．

15．Why weren't people even aware of the first generation of televisions or radios？
16．How did the speaker's friend feelabout the invention of cars and trains？
Passage Three
Can you imagine ice that does not melt and is not wet？Have you ever heard ofdry ice？Dry ice is made by freezing a gas．It is quite different from ordinary ice which is simple frozen water．Dry ice was first manufactured in 1925．It has since fulfilled the hopes of its inventors．It can be used for making artificial fog in the movies．When steam is passed over dry ice，avery dense vapor rises．It can also be used for destroying insects in grain supplies．It is more practical than ordinary ice， because ittakesup lessspace and isone hundred forty-two degree colder．Since it turns into steam instead ofmelting into water，it is cleaner to use．For this reason，it is extremely popular，and many people prefer it to ordinary ice．Dry ice is so cold that ifyou touch it with your bare fingers，it willburn you．
Questions 17to 20are based on the passage you have just heard．
17．What is dry ice made of？
18．How is an artificialfog made in the movies？

Importance of Teamwork
As teamwork is increasingly important in modern society，everyone should train his ability to cooperate with others．
Today's society is no longer aself-sufficient one，but one in which all the people depend on each other for existence．Only for existence，not to mention the pursuit and obtainment of happiness，one can't do without the ability to work harmoniously with others．In the highly developed society today，one can almost accomplish nothing without joint efforts．Every loaf of bread，every article ofclothes，every house or apartment，every means oftransportation is the product ofcooperative efforts．We play with other children in kindergartens；we study with our classmates at schools；and we will work with our fellow workers or colleagues in factories or companies． What we have got through teamwork is not only self-improvement，personalsuccessbutalso the satisfaction at both our devotion to common causes and the sense of collective honor．
To meet the needs of both personal improvement and the sophisticated society，we should learn to cooperate with each other and adjust to each other．Only in this way can we achieve successes and satisfy ourselves as wellas the society．
