Part Ⅱ Reading Comprehension(35 minutes)

Directions: There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and m ark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.

Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage:

We sometimes think humans are uniquely vulnerable to anxiety, but stress seems t o affect the immune defenses of lower animals too. In one experiment, for example, behavioral immunologist（免疫学家）Mark Laudenslager, at the University of Denver, gave mild electric shocks to 24 rats. Half the animals could switch off the current by turning a wheel in their enclosure, while the other half could not. The rats in the two groups were paired so that each time one rat turned the wheel it protected both itself and its helpless partner from the shock. Laudenslager found that the immune response was depressed below normal in the helpless rats but not in those that could turn off the electricity. What he has demonstrated, he believes, is that lack of control over an event, not the experience itself, is what weakens the immune system.

Other researchers agree. Jay Weiss, a psychologist at Duke University School of Medicine, has shown that animals who are allowed to control unpleasant stimuli don't develop sleep disturbances or changes in brain chemistry typical of stressed rats. But if the animals are confronted with situations they have no control over, they later behave passively when faced with experiences they can control. Such findings reinforce psychologists' suspicions that the experience or perception of helplessness is one of the most harmful factors in depression.

One of the most startling examples of how the mind can alter the immune response was discovered hankie. In 1975 psychologist Robert Adder at the University of Rochester School of Medicine conditioned（使形成条件反射） mice t o avoid saccharin（糖精） by simultaneously feeding them the sweetener and injecting them with a drug that while suppressing their immune systems caused stomach upsets. Associating the saccharin with the stomach pains, the mice quickly learned to avoid the sweetener. In order to extinguish this dislike for the sweetener, Aderreeposed the animals to saccharin, this time without the drug, and was astonished to find that those mice that had received the highest amounts of sweetener during t heir earlier conditioning died. He could only speculate that he had so successfully conditioned the rats that saccharin alone now served to weaken their immune systems enough to kill them.

11. Laudenslager's experiment showed that the immune system of those rats who could turn off the electricity _________.

A) was altered B) was strengthened C) was weakened D) was not affected

12. According to the passage, the experience of helplessness causes rats to _____.

A) turn off the electricity

B) try to control unpleasant stimuli

C) become abnormally suspicious

D) behave passively in controllable situations

13. The reason why the mice in Ader's experiment avoided saccharin was that ____.

A) they associated it with stomachaches

B) it affected their immune systems

C) it led to stomach pains

D) they disliked its taste

14. The passage tells us that the most probable reason for the death of the mice in Ader's experiment was that _________.

A) the sweetener was poisonous to them

B) their immune systems had been altered by the mind

C) they had been weakened psychologically by the saccharin

D) they had taken too much sweetener during earlier conditioning

15. It can be concluded from the passage that the immune systems of animals ________.

A) can be altered by electric shocks

B) can be weakened by conditioning

C) can be suppressed by drug injections

D) can be affected by frequent doses of saccharin

Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage:

The destruction of our natural resources and contamination of our food supply continue to occur, largely because of the extreme difficulty in affixing（把……固定）legal responsibility on those who continue to treat our environment with reckless abandon（放任）. Attempts to prevent pollution by legislation, economic incentives and friendly persuasion have been met by lawsuits, personal and industrial denial and long delays ― not only in accepting responsibility, but more importantly, in doing something about it.

It seems that only when government decides it can afford tax incentives or production sacrifices is there any initiative for change. Where is industry's and our recognition that rotating mankind's great treasure is the single most important responsibility? If ever there will be time for environmental health profess inlets come to the frontlines and provide leadership to solve environmental problems, that time is now.

We are being asked, and, in fact, the public is demanding that we take positive action. It is our responsibility as professionals in environmental health to make the difference. Yes, the ecologists, the environmental activists and the conservationist serve to communicate, stimulate thinking and promote behavioral change. However, it is those of us who are paid to make the decisions to develop, improve and enforce environmental standards, I submit, who must lead the charge.

We must recognize that environmental health issues do not stop at city limits, county lines, state or even federal boundaries. We can no longer afford to be tunnelvisited in our approach. We must visualize issues from every perspective t o make the objective decisions. We must express our views clearly to prevent media distortion and public confusion.

I believe we have a threepart mission for the present. First, we must continue to press for improvements in the quality of life that people can make for themselves. Second, we must investigate and understand the link between environment and health. Third, we must be able to communicate technical information in a form that citizens can understand. If we can accomplish these three goals in this decade, maybe we can finally stop environmental degradation, and not merely hold i t back. We will then be able to spend pollution dollars truly on prevention rather than on bandages.

16. We can infer from the first two paragraphs that the industrialists disregard environmental protection chiefly because _________.

A) it is difficult for them to take effective measures

B) time has not yet come for them to put due emphasis on it

C) they are reluctant to sacrifice their own economic interests

D) they are unaware of the consequences of what they are doing

17. The main task now facing ecologists, environmental activists and conservationists is ____.

A) to arouse public awareness of the importance of environmental protection

B) to prevent pollution by legislation, economic incentives and persuasion

C) to improve the quality of life by enforcing environmental standards

D) to take radical measures to control environmental pollution

18. The word tunnel visioned”(Line 2, Para. 4) most probably means “____” .

A) narrow minded B) short sighted

C）able to see only one aspect D) blind to the facts

19. Which of the following, according to the author, should play the leading role in the solution of environmental problems?

A) The cooperation of ecologists, environmental activists and conservationists.

B) The efforts of environmental health professionals.

C) The industry's understanding and support.

D) Legislation and government intervention.

20. Which of the following is true according to the last paragraph?

A) More money should be spent in order to stop pollution.

B) Environmental degradation will be stopped by the end of this decade.

C) Ordinary citizens have no access to technical information on pollution.

D) Efforts should be exerted on pollution prevention instead of on remedial measures.

Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:

British universities, groaning under the burden of a huge increase in student numbers, are warning that the tradition of a free education is at risk. The universities have threatened to impose an admission fee on students to plug a gap in revenue if the government does not act to improve their finances and scrap some public spending cutbacks.

The government responded to the universities' threat by setting up the most fundamental review of higher education for a generation, under a nonparty troubleshooter（调停人）, Sir Ron Dearing.

One in three school leaversenters higher education, five times the number when the last review took place thirty years ago.

Everyone agrees a system that is feeling the strain after rapid expansion needs a lot more money ― but there is little hope of getting it from the taxpayer and not much scope for attracting more finance from business.

Most colleges believe students should contribute to tuition costs, something that is common elsewhere in the world but would mark a revolutionary change in Britain. Universities want the government to introduce a loan scheme for tuition fee s and have suspended their own threatened action for now. They await Dearing's advice, hoping it will not be too late ― some are already reported to be in financial difficulty.

As the century nears its end, the whole concept of what a university should be is under the microscope. Experts ponder how much they can use computers instead o f classrooms, talk of the need for lifelong learning and refer to students as  consumers”.

The Confederation（联盟）of British Industry, the key employers 'organization, wants even more expansion in higher education to help fight competition on world markets from booming Asian economies. But the government has doubts about more expansion. The Times newspaper agrees, complaining that quality has suffered as student numbers soared, with close tutorial supervision giving way to mass production methods more typical of European universities”.

21. The chief concern of British universities is ____.

A) how to tackle their present financial difficulty

B) how to improve their educational technology

C) how to expand the enrollment to meet the needs of enterprises

D) how to put an end to the current tendency of quality deterioration

22. We can learn from the passage that in Britain _________.

A) higher education is provided free of charge

B) universities are mainly funded by businesses

C) the government pays dearly for its financial policy

D) students are ready to accept loan schemes for tuition

23. What was the percentage of high school graduates admitted to universities in Britain thirty years ago?

A) About 15%. B) or so. 20% C) Below 10%. D) Above 30%.

24. It can be inferred from the passage that _____.

A) British employers demand an expansion in enrollment at the expense of quality

B) the best way out for British universities is to follow their European counterparts

C) the British government will be forced to increase its spending on higher education

D) British students will probably have to pay for their higher education in the near future

25. Which of the following is the viewpoint of the Times newspaper?

A) British universities should expand their enrollment to meet the needs of industry.

B) Expansion in enrollment is bound to affect the quality of British higher education.

C) British universities should help fight competition on world markets.

D) European universities can better meet the needs of the modern world.

Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:

There's a simple premise behind what Larry Myers does for a living: If you can smell it, you can find it.

Myers is the founder of Auburn University's Institute for Biological Detection Systems, the main task of which is to chase the ultimate in detection devices ― an artificial nose.

For now, the subject of their research is little more than a stack of gleaming c hips tucked away in a laboratory drawer. But soon, such a tool could be hanging from the belts of police, arson(纵火) investigators and foodsafe tyinspectors.

The technology that they are working on would suggest quite reasonably that, within three to five years, we'll have some workable sensors ready to use. Such de vices might find wide use in places that attract terrorists. Police could detect drugs, bodies and bombs hidden in cars, while food inspectors could easily test food and water for contamination.

The implications for revolutionary advances in public safety and the food industry are astonishing. But so, too, are the possibilities for abuse: Such machines could determine whether a woman is ovulating（排卵）, without aphysicalexam ― or even her knowledge.

One of the traditional protectors of American liberty is that it has been impossible to search everyone. That's getting not to be the case.

Artificial biosensors created at Auburn work totally differently from anything e ver seen before. AromaScan, for example, is a desktop machine based on a bank of chips sensitive to specific chemicals that evaporate into the air. As air is sucked into the machine, chemicals pass over the sensor surfaces and produce changes in the electrical current flowing through them. Those current changes are logged into a computer that sorts out odors based on their electrical signatures.

Myers says they expect to load a single fingernailsize chip with thousands of odor receptors（感受器），enough to create a sensor that's nearly as sensitive as a dog's nose.

26. Which of the following is within the capacity of the artificial nose being developed?

A) Monitoring food processing.

B) Performing physical examinations.

C) Locating places which attract terrorists.

D) Detecting drugs and water contamination.

27. A potential problem which might be caused by the use of an artificial nose is ____.

A) a hazard to physical health B) negligence of public safety

C) a threat to individual privacy D) an abuse of personal freedom

28. The word logged” (Line 4, Para. 7) most probably means ____”.

A) preset B) simulated C) entered D) processed

29. To produce artificial noses for practical use, it is essential ____.

A) to find chemicals that can alter the electrical current passing through

B) to develop microchips with thousands of odor receptors

C) to design a computer program to sort out smells

D) to invent chips sensitive to various chemicals

30. The author's attitude towards Larry Myers' work is _________.

A) approving B) overenthusiastic C) cautious D) suspicious

More people who travel long distances complain of jetlag (喷气飞行时差反应). Jetlag makes business travelers less productive and more prone 61 making mistakes. It is actually caused by 62 of yourbody clock” ― a small cluster of brain cells that controls the timing of biological 63 . The body clock is designed for a 64 rhythm of daylight and darkness, so that it is thrown out of balance when it 65 daylight and darkness at the“wrong”times in a new time zone. The 66 of jetlag often persist for days 67 the internal body clock slowly adjusts to the new time zone.

Now a new anti-jetlag system is 68 that is based on proven 69 pioneering scientific research. Dr. Martin MooreEdemas 70 a practical strategy to adjust the body clock much sooner to the new time zone 71 controlled exposure to bright light. The time zone shift is easy to accomplish and eliminates 72 of the discomfort of jetlag.

A successful time zone shift depends on knowing the exact times to either 73 or avoid bright light. Exposure to light at the wrong time can actually make jetlag worse. The proper schedule 74 light, exposure depends a great deal on 75 travel plans.

Data on a specific flight itinerary (旅行路线) and the individual'ssleep 76 ]are used to produce a Trip Guide with 77 on exactly when to be exposed t o bright light.

When the Trip Guide calls 78 bright light you should spend time outdo ors if possible. If it is dark outside, or the weather is bad, 79 you are on an airplane, you can use a special light device to provide the necessary light 80 for a range of activities such as reading, watching TV or working.
