¡¡¡¡In a great hurry,I didn't hear clearly the head waiter's instruction that we should go into the kitchen through one door and out from the other.So when I took two plates of eggs and bacon and an orange juice out to the restaurant,I went straight towards the wrong door and collided with another waiter coming in!

¡¡¡¡Worst of all was that I wore a pair of smart shoes but with high heels! A few hours later I was in agony yet had no time to change them. By the time we finished serving dinner at about 10:30 I was completely exhausted. Nevertheless, I learnt something through my experience.
