PartⅢ Reading Comprehension（35minutes） 

Directions：There are four passages in this part． Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements．For each of them there are four choices marked A），B），C）and D）．You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre． 

Passage One 

Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage： 

Statuses are marvelous human inventions that enable us to get along with one another and to determine where we"fit"in society．As we go about our everyday lives，we mentally attempt to place people in terms of their statuses．For example，we must judge whether the person inthe library is a reader or a librarian，whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman，whether the unfamiliar person on our property is a thief or a meter reader，and so on． 

The statuses we assume often vary with the people we encounter and change throughout life．Most of us can，at very high speed，assume the statuses that various situations require．Much of social interaction consists of identifying and selecting among appropriate statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us．This means that we fit our actions to those of other people based on a constant mental process of appraisal and interpretation．Although some of us find the task more difficult than others，most of us perform it rather effortlessly． 

A status has been compared to ready-made clothes．Within certain limits the buyer choose style and fabric．But an American is not free to choose the costume of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince．We must choose from among the clothing presented by fit，as well as by our pocketbook．Having made a choice from minor adjustments，we tend to be limited to what the stores choice among them is limited． 

51．In the first paragraph，the writer tells us that statuses can help us _______ ． 

A）determine whether a person is fit fora certain job 

B）behave appropriately in relation to other people 

C）protect ourselves in unfamiliar situations 

D）make friends with other people 

52．According to the writer，people often assume different statuses _______ ． 

A）in order to identify themselves with others 

B）in order to better identify others 

C）as their mental processes change 

D）as the situation changes 

53．The word"appraisal"most probably means _______． 

A）involvement 

B）appreciation 

C）assessment 

D）presentation 

54．In the last sentence of the second paragraph，the pronoun"it"refers to" _______"． 

A）fitting our actions to those of other people appropriately 

B）identification of other people's statuses 

C）selecting one's own statuses 

D）constant mental process 

55．By saying that"an American is not free to choose the costume of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince"，the writer means _______． 

A）different people have different styles of clothes 

B）ready-made clothes may need alterations 

C）statuses come ready made just like clothes 

D）our choice of statuses is limited 

Passage Two 

Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage： 

What kind of human being will the future spaceman be？ 

Will he need bones of steel and powerful muscles to resist rocket thrust，the lungs of a glass blower，a mighty heart，the calmness of an acrobat，unconscious death urges，or a schizophrenic（患精神分裂症的）drove toward isolation？ Popular ideas of a spaceman tend to be funny composites of fiction and fact． 

A more realistic portrait emerges from the young science of bioastronautics，the newest and strangest of medical disciplines．The astronaut may be described as a young man of high intelligence who is normal to an abnormal degree．On earth he may well have been a high diver，high jumper，polevaulter，or acrobat．He must be highly motivated，carefully trained，and he must want to come back． 

His heart and lungs must be healthy but need not be exceptionally developed，for his cabin will be pressurized．Huge muscles may actually be disadvantageous，for he will have almost no way to get exercise，and he will find that the strength of a year-old child is adequate in theweightlessness of space．A firm body and a short， strong neck will help him to withstand（抗拒；经得起…）the tremendous forces encountered at take-off．Most important physically，his digestive system must be one that will not be upset by weightlessness；he must not be subject to motion sickness． 

56．All the following are popular beliefs about the future spaceman EXCEPT that _______ ． 

A）faced with isolation，he is brave enough and not liable to go mad 

B）he needs to have a strong death complex 

C）he must have strong bones and powerful muscles 

D）he must be cool-headed 

57．Which of the following is NOT be considered by the author as a more realistic image of the future spaceman？ 

A）He must have superior intelligence． 

B）He is young． 

C）He should have a strong desire to survive． 

D）He doesn't get upset easily． 

58．Bioastronautics is mostly related to _______ ． 

A）literature 

B）the science of medicine 

C）biology 

D）disciplines and regulations 

59．"normal to an abnormal degree"（Para．3）means _______ ． 

A）seemingly normal but actually abnormal 

B）so ordinary that he is undistinguished in every way 

C）extremely healthy，and there is nothing abnormal with him 

D）so normal that no one believes it is true 

60．To the future spaceman，what is most physically important is that _______ ． 

A）his vital capacity must be as great at a glass blower's 

B）he must have a short and firm neck 

C）his heart must be comparatively large 

D）his digestive system should not be upset by weightlessness 

Passage Three 

Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage： 

With fifteen years Britain and other nations should be well on with the building of huge industrial complexes for the recycling of waste．The word rubbish could lose its meaning because everything which goes into the dumps would be made into something useful．Even the most dangerous and unpleasant wastes would provide energy if nothing else． 

The latest project is to take a city of around half a million inhabitants and discover exactly what raw materials go into it and what go out．The aim is to find out how much of these raw materials could be provided if a plant for recycling waste were built just outside the city．This plant would recycle not only metal such as steel，lead and copper，but also paper and rubber as well． 

Another new project is being setup to discover the best ways of sorting and separating the rubbish．When this project is complete，the rubbish will be processed like this：First，it will pass through sharp metal bars which will tear open the plastic bags in which rubbish is usually packed；then it will pass through a powerful fan to separate the lightest elements from the heavy solids；after that founders and rollers will break up everything that can be broken．Finally，the rubbish will pass under magnets（磁铁），which will remove the bits of iron and steel；the rubber and plastic will then be sorted out in the final stage． 

The first full-scale giant recycling plants are perhaps fifteen years away．Indeed，with the growing cost of transporting rubbish to more distant dumps，some big cities will be forced to build their own recycling plants before long． 

61．The phrase"should be well on with..."（Para．1）most probably means _______ ． 

A）have completed what was started 

B）get ready to start 

C）have achieved a great deal in 

D）put an end to 

62．What is NOT mentioned as a part of the recycling process described in paragraph 3？ 

A）Breaking up whatever is breakable． 

B）Sharpening metal bars． 

C）Separating light elements from the heavy ones． 

D）Sorting out small pieces of metal． 

63．What's the main reason for big cities to build their own recycling plants？ 

A）To deal with wastes in a better way． 

B）To protect the environment from pollution． 

C）To get raw materials locally． 

D）To get big profits from those plants． 

64．The first full-scale huge recycling plants _______ ． 

A）began to operate fifteen years ago 

B）will probably take less than fifteen years to build 

C）will be built fifteen years later 

D）will probably be in operation in fifteen years 

65．The passage is mainly about _______ ． 

A）a cheap way to get energy 

B）the location of recycling plants 

C）new ways of recycling wastes 

D）the probability of city environment 

Passage Four 

Questions 66to 70are based on the following passage： 

Do you remember last summer，when furious travelers were pounding on Congress to do something about airline customer service？Airlines promised to improve，and they adopted new standards just before Christmas．But as another summer nears，plenty of experienced travelers don't see much improvement in customer service overall． 

This month，the Department of Transportation's（DOT）inspector general's office will issue its first critical article on whether airlines are honoring their promises．One survey suggests problems：The number of complaints to the DOT about the top 10 airlines in the first quarter soared 89％from a year ago． 

Hit last summer by passenger complaints and the threat of consumer-protection laws by Congress，14 carriers voluntarily agreed to adopt a set of basic customer-service standards called Customers First．From immediate refunds to truthful reservation agents to toilets that flush during onboard delays，the"12 commitments" to passengers were introduced as a major effort to improve service．Since then，airlines have been redesigning websites，retraining employees and upgrading technology． 

Recently，DOT inspector general Kenneth Mead，at McCain's request，sent 20 examiners to airports to document whether each airline is doing what it promised，Mead cautions travelers shouldn't expect too much．Most of the promises are aimed at better communication with customers，not problems free flights． 

"We think passengers，both business and leisure，perceive travel as more of a quarrel these days，"spokeswoman Shelly Sasson says．"Some of this is perception，but a lot is reality．""And when improvements are made，it takes a long time for them to be noticed"，she says． 

Now，the efforts may be working．During the first quarter，Delta had the second-lowest rate of complaints among the top 10carriers．Still，its rate，along with other carriers'，is up from last year．McCain and other lawmakers say new consumer protection laws aren't out of the question if the industry's voluntary program doesn't work． 

66．The passage tells us that _______ ． 

A）passenger complaints increase though airlines have taken steps to improve air service 

B）passenger complaints decrease for airlines have taken steps to improve air service 

C）air service has been improved greatly though it is hard to notice by passengers 

D）air service needs improving badly as the results of passenger complaints 

67．Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage ？ 

A）Government has sent officials to check any improvement the air service airlines have made．B）Some people suggest passengers show more understanding to airlines about their efforts to better air service． 

C）To improve air service doesn't mean that there will no longer be any deficiencies in air traveling． 

D）It is thought that passengers should be patient when they are waiting for any improvement made by airlines． 

68．Which of the following statements is closest in meaning to the sentence"Some of this is perception，but a lot is reality．"？（Para．5） 

A）Some people's complaints about air service are rather subjective，but most people's are fairly objective． 

B）When people travel by air，they usually quarrel，which is a fact passengers all see． 

C）Some people take a biased view on air service because they don't see facts． 

D）Most people saw facts，but a few people failed． 

69．The author has written the last paragraph mainly to mean _______ ． 

A）the rate of complaints is going up in all airlines in spite of the efforts they made 

B）improvements some airlines have made are not effective，which leads to more complaints 

C）there may be a need to pass laws to improve airline customers service 

D）some people are too aggressive when complaining about air service though airlines have made great efforts on it 

70．In paragraph 1，the phrase"pounding on" means" _______"． 

A）striking at 

B）urging 

C）attacking 

D）soundings with loud noises

Part V Writing（For reference only） 

To Be Busy Or To Be Idle 

Many people we know prefer to live a busy life． They enjoy making tight schedules and doing everything in a hurry．They simply like the feeling of being totally engaged in their work．They often stick to one principle： work hard and play hard． 

Still，there are other people who find greatfun in an idle life．They hate to hurry all the time，arguing that they take their time just to reach high efficiency．In fact， mostofthem are productive despite their loose schedules， and only a few live a non productive life．Feeling empty at heart，they killtime in various ways． 

I agree with the work－hard－and－play－hard principle because only in this way can we complete our work in time and be able to relax after a good days work
