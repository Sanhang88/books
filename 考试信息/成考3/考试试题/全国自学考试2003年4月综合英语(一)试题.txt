Passage 1
Bill Trew worked on the night shift(夜班) in an old coal mine called Park Deep. Day and night 180 miners worked underground there, more than 6,00 feet down. They all took their share of night work, but Bill always worked at night. he said he preferred it.
One day he came home as usual at half past seven in the morning. He had his ‘Supper’, as he called it, and went to bed. An unusual dream troubled his sleep. Afterwards, the only thing he remembered about it was― a throbbing(跳动) blue light.
Bill got up in the afternoon as usual. It was a strange getting up―because he could still see the blue light in front of his eyes. As the evening grew darker, the light grew stronger. Bill got ready for the night shift. But by 8 o'clock the blue light was so bright that he could hardly see anything else. He and his wife were very puzzled. Bill had never been sick before.
“Don't go to work,”Mrs. Trew said.“If it isn't better by tomorrow, I'll have to send for the doctor.”
Bill didn't go to work. He sat in an armchair, awake but with closed eyes. Even then the blueness was like a living thing. It surrounded him, silent, throbbing. The family went to bed but Bill wasn't tired: he stayed in his armchair.
At 11 o'clock a long, loud explosion shook the ground. Bill opened his eyes and jumped to his feet. The blue light was gone! He rushed outside. Someone shouted,“Gas! gas in Park Deep! Oh pity the night shift!”

Passage 2
Generally speaking, the British Isles have a temperate(温和) climate, not an extreme one. The prevailing(盛行) winds over Britain are southwesterly ones. The weather from day to day is variable, because it is controlled by depressions(低气压)from the Atlantic Ocean which, moving in a northeasterly or easterly direction, pass over or near the British Isles. Occasionally during winter months, between early December and the middle of March, northern winds may sometimes prevail, bringing cold weather and snowfalls which may last for several days or even 2 or 3 weeks, but seldom more than that. The English spring is very changeable, with warm and cold days in between until June. After the first week of May, you can take off your overcoats once and for all until the middle of October. But you certainly have to keep your raincoats and umbrellas close at hand, in any case.

At best, out of the 31 days of July, you might get 21 days of dry weather and sunshine. In July of 1973, London did not se a single drop of rain, but that was a rare exception. At that time, foreign tourists kept on asking the British where they had “imported” their sunshine form. Throughout the British Isles there is an annual rainfall of about 110 centimeters. England alone gets 89 centimeters  annually of that British total. One an average, May to July are the driest months in England, and November to early March the wettest .A period of as long as 3 weeks without rain is exceptional and normally confined to limited areas like the coasts of southwest England,  Wales and the west coast of Scotland. June and July are the months of longest sunlight: from about 4:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
36.Which of the following is Not REUE of the climate in Britain?
[A]Prevailing southwesterly winds.
[B]Variable weather from day to day.
[C]Snowfalls lasting for 2-3 weeks very winter.
[D]Warm and cold days in between in spring.
37.The depressions from the Atlantic Ocean moved ___.
[A]from the northeast to the west
[B]from the southwest to the east
[C]from the northwest to the southeast
[D]from the east to the southwest
38.The period that is both coldest and wettest in Britain is ____.
[A]between December and the middle of March
[B]between early November and April
[C]between November and early March
[D]between early December and early March
39.A person who hates both rain and hot weather should choose to visit Britain in ____.
[A]May    [B]June     [C]July     [D]August
