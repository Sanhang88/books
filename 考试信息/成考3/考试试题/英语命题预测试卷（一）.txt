Passage One
All the housewives who went to the new supermarket had one great ambition: to be the lucky customer who did not have to pay for her shopping. For this was what the notice just inside the entrance promised. It said: °∞Remember, once a week, one of our customers gets free goods. This May Be Your Lucky Day!°±
For several weeks Mrs. Edwards hoped, like many of her friends, to be the lucky customer. Unlike her friends, she never gave up hoping. The cupboards in kitchen were full of things which she did not need. Her husband tried to advise her against buying things but failed. She dreamed of the day when the manager of the supermarket would approach her and say: °∞Madam, this is Your Lucky Day. Everything in your basket is free.°±
One Friday morning, after she had finished her shopping and had taken it to her car, she found that she had forgotten to buy any tea. She dashed back to the supermarket, got the tea and went towards the cash-desk. As she did so, she saw the manager of the supermarket approach her. °∞Madam,°± he said, holding out his hand, °∞I want to congratulate you!

Passage Two
Deep inside a mountain near Sweetwater in East. Tennessee is a body of water known as the Lost Sea. It is listed by the Guinness Book of Would Records as the world°Øs largest underground lake. The Lost Sea is part of an extensive and historic cave system called Craighead Caverns.
The caverns have been known and used since the days of the Cherokee Indian nation. The cave expands into a series of huge rooms from a small opening on the side of the mountain. Approximately one mile from the entrance, in a room called °∞The Council Room,°± many Indian artisfacts have been found. Some of the items discovered include pottery, arrowheads, weapons, and jewelry.
For many years there were persistent rumors of a large underground lake somewhere in a cave, but it was not discovered until 1905. In that year, a thirteen-year-old boy named Ben Sands crawled through a small opening three hundred feet underground. He found himself in a large cave half filled with water.
Today tourists visit the Lost Sea and ride far out onto it in glass-bottomed boats powered by electric motors. More than thirteen acres of water have been mapped out so far and still no end to the lake has been found. Even though teams of divers have tried to explore the Lost Sea, the full extent of it is still unknown.

Passage Three
Generations of Americans have been brought up to believe that a good breakfast is one life°Øs essentials. Eating breakfast at the start of the day, we have all been told, and told again, is as necessary as putting gasoline in the family car before starting a trip.
But for many people the thought of food first thing in the morning is by no means a pleasure. So despite all the efforts, they still take no breakfast. Between 1977 and 1983, the latest year for which figures are available, the number of people who didn°Øt have breakfast, increased by 33 percent.
For those who feel pain of guilt about not eating breakfast, however, there is some good news. Several studies in the last few years indicate that, for adults especially, there may be nothing wrong with omitting breakfast. °∞Going without breakfast does not affect performance,°± said Arrold E. Bender, former professor of the nutrition at Queen Elizabeth College in London, °∞nor does giving people breakfast improve performance.°±
Scientific evidence linking breakfast to better health or better performance is surprisingly inadequate, and most of the recent work involves children, not adults, °∞The literature°±, says one researcher, Dr. Erresto at the University of Texas, °∞is poor°±.
71. The latest year for which figures could be obtained is _______.
A. the year the author wrote the articleB. 1977
C. any year between 1997 and 1983D. 1983
72. For those who do not take breakfast, the good news is that _______.
several studies have been done in the past few years
the omission of breakfast does no harm to one°Øs health
adults have especially made studies in this field
eating little in the morning is good for health
73. °∞°≠nor does giving people breakfast improve performance°± means ______.
anyone without breakfast does improve his performance
not giving people breakfast improve performance
having breakfast does not improve performance, either
people having breakfast do improve their performance
74. The word °∞literature°± in the last sentence refers to _______.
A. stories, poems, plays, etc.B. written works on a particular subject
C. any printed materialD. the modern literature of America
75. What is implied but NOT stated by the author is that _______.
breakfast does not affect performance
Dr. Erresto is engaged in research work at an institution of higher learning
not eating breakfast might affect the health of children
Professor Bender once taught college courses in nutrition in London

Passage Four
About 35% of all high school graduates in America continue their education in an institution of higher learning. The word college is used to refer to either a college or a university. These institutions offer four-year programs that lead to a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor Science (B.S.) degree. Some students attend a junior college (providing only a two-year program) for one to two years before entering a four-year college as a sophomore (∂˛ƒÍº∂…˙) or junior (»˝ƒÍº∂…˙).
It is generally easier to be accepted at a state university than at a private one. Most private schools require strict entrance examinations and a high grade point average (GPA), as well as specific college prep classes in high school. Private schools cost considerably more than state colleges and famous private schools are very expensive. Poorer students can sometimes attend, however, by earning scholarships. Some college graduates go on to earn advanced masters or doctoral degrees in grad (graduate) school. Occupations in certain fields such as law or medicine require such advanced studies.
Since college costs are very high, most students work at part-time jobs. Some have full-time jobs and go to school part-time. Often some will take five or more years to complete a four-year program because of money / job demands on their time.
While the college and work demands take up the great part of a student°Øs time, most still enjoy social activities. Sports, dances, clubs, movies, and plays are all very popular. However, gathering together for long, philosophical talks at a favorite meeting place on or near the university is probably the most popular activity.
76. College education is _______ in America.
A. quite commonB. very rare
C. something difficultD. almost impossible
77. Which of the following is NOT required for entering most private schools.
A. entrance examinations B. taking part in many activities
C. GPAD. college prep classes
78. How can poor students attend private schools?
A. Only by working at part-time jobs.B. Only by working at full-time jobs.
C. Only by earning scholarships. D. All of above.
79. The American college students like to _______ most of all.
A. discuss problems on philosophyB. play balls
C. earn enough moneyD. go to the cinemas or theatres
80. The best title for this passage is _______.
A. Part-time jobsB. American college
C. Popular activity D. A new system

In Money Everything?
 I don°Øt think money is everything, but we can°Øt do without it. Fox example, money can°Øt buy us happiness and a good education. And for another example, money can°Øt buy us good health and a long life. But we can not live without money. We need it for our daily necessities such as food, clothes and transportation. What°Øs more, we need it to live a better life. In short, we should learn the value of money and make the most of its advantages.
