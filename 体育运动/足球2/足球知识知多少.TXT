TEAMS Each soccer team has eleven players and three substitute, or reserve players. The team consists of a goalkeeper, defenders, midfield players, and forwards (or strikers). The object of the game is to get the ball into your opponent's goal.

球队 每支球队有11名场上队员和3名替补队员。球队包括守门员、防守队员、中场队员和前锋。比赛的目的就是要将足球踢人对方的球门。

THE MATCH A game of soccer is called a match and is split into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute break at halftime. A referee and two assistants make sure that nobody cheats or breaks the rules.

比赛 足球比赛分为两个半场，每半场各45分钟，上下半场中间有15分钟的休息时间。比赛有一位主裁判和两名助理裁判，他们的职责是监督是否有球员作弊或者是犯规。

GOALKEEPNG Goalkeeping is a special skill. While the rest of the team can afford to make mistakes, if the goalkeeper makes one, it usually results in a goal for the opposition. Above Your Head The best way to catch a ball above your head is by joining the thumbs and forefingers of your hands together so there is a small arch between your hands. Chest or Head Jump off one leg and cradle the ball comfortably to your chest. The ball should rest on your forearms, with your hands holding it from above. Left or Right Always try to get both hands behind the ball and hold on tight. As soon as you've caught it, bring the ball quickly into the safety of your body.

守门 守门是一项特殊的技能。队里的其他球员有失误问题还不太要紧，但守门员的失误就常常导致对方进球。 过顶球 处理过顶球的最佳方法是用大拇指和其他手指一起来接球，因为那样双手之间可形成一个拱形。胸前或眼前球 单脚跳起，把球自然地抱在怀里。用前臂夹住球，两手从前臂上方抱住球。左侧球或右侧球 要尽量从球后方来牢牢地接住球，一旦接住了球，就要赶快把球抱住。
