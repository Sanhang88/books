Tell me what's on you mind I'll freak you anytime
I'm on a mission and I won't stop till I'm make you mine
I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk
If I could get inside your head, I'd even like your thought
I wanna know what your feeling inside Wanna go to movie,wanna hang out tonight
Girl I'm really feeling you and you know we can do
Whatever, together, forever, just as long as It's soon
Rap 
No matter where I go, no matter what I do
Every girl I see just reminds me of you I'm feeling kindahazy
I must be going crazy
I think I'm losing my mind and only you can save me
I wanna know what you do when you are being alone
I wanna know what you say when you talk on the phone
I wanna know what you do when you hanging with your girls
I wanna know who you are come in to my world

The Rose
ʣAmanda Mcbroom
Amanda Mcbroom
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring
Becomes the rose
Some say love
It is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love
It is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love
It is a hunger an endless aching need
I say love
It is a flower and you it's only seed
It's the heart
Afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
It's the dream
Afraid of walking that never takes the chance
It's the one
who won't be taken who can't seem to give
And the soul
Afraid of dying that never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think
That love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember
In the winter for beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
in the spring becomes the rose
Rap
Life is a gift and you gotta learn to live
It if you believe in love
You gotta learn to give it
Tryin' to find someone who's kind is hard to do
You want the love but you really don't know what to do
You're just afraid of someone breaking your heart
You never learned to live you gave up from the start
You felt the pain but it made you strong
So remember no matter what you will go on

Sugar Sugar
Andy Kim/Jeff Barry

Sugar Oh, honey honey
You are my candy boy
And you've got me waiting you
Honey Oh,
sugar sugar You are my candy boy
And you 've got me waiting you
I just can't believe
The loveliness of loving you
I just can't believe
The one I love can feel it too
Sugar Oh,
honey honey
You are my candy boy
And you've got me waiting you
When I kissed you,
Boy I know how sweet a kiss could be
Like the silver sunshine
Pour your sweetness over me

You're my baby
