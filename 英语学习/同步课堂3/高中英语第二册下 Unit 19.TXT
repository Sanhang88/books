A railroad line was completed after six years of hard labour in the forests and wet lands. Over two thousand workmen died from yellow fever and other kinds of illness.

At least 15,000 died befor the French gave up building the canal. For years the rejected machines lay in the forests. At the close of the Spanish-American War the United States bought a piece of land ten miles across the Isthmus. Immediate attention was given to the control of illnesses.
