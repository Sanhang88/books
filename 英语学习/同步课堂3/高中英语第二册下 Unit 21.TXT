Unit 21
1. Have you decided what music you'd like us to play at the party?
would like sb to do sth  "想让某人做某事"如：
I'd like him to go with me.
我想让他和我一起去。
would like 还有以下两种用法：
(1) would like sth 如：
Would you like some tea?
(2) would like to do sth 如：
I'd like to study medicine and become a doctor.
2. at the end some songs that everyone's familiar with,…
familiar adj"熟悉的"，常用于句型 sb be familiar with sth/sb 和sb/sth be familiar to sb 意思是"某人对某事或某人熟悉"。
例如：
I'm of course familiar with your house.
我当然熟悉你的房子。
His name is very familiar to me.
我很熟悉他的名字。
3. I think at the beginning we'd rather have some fairly quiet and peaceful music.
① would rather + (not) do =would prefer to do "宁愿（不）……"。例如：
1) I would rather read a novel at home tonight.
我宁愿今天晚上在家读小说。
2) Which would you rather have, tea or coffee?
3) I'd prefer to walk home rather than go by taxi.
我宁愿步行回家，不愿乘计程车。
② would rather +从句（谓语动词用过去式）例如：

4.Otherwise we won't be able to hear ourselves talk.

I often hear him sing this American song.
5. The people performing all play different instruments.
performing 是现在分词，在句中作宾语，修饰people.
相当于一个定语从句。The people performing =The people who are performing. 作宾语用的现在分词如果是单词，一般放在名词的前面，如果是分词短语，则放在名词的后面，它的作用相当于定语从句。如：
China is a developing country.
The boy (who is) standing there is a friend of mine.
有时单个的现在分词作定语也可以放在它所修饰的名词后面，如：
The people smoking are not welcome here.
6.Many people earn their living by writing music.
earn one's /a living= make a living "谋生"。例如：

这个可怜的孩子只得靠送报谋生。
He has to do some odd jobs to earn a living.
他不得不靠做零活来谋生。
7. They usually write exact instructions how the music is to be played.
"how the music is to be played "是由连接副词how 引导的同位语从句，用以说明前面名词instructions 的具体内容。如：
You have no idea how worried we were!
你不知道我们是多么着	急啊！
He raised the question how we could get the money.
他提出了怎样能弄到钱这样一个问题。
be+to do sth 常用来表示按计划、安排将要发生的事或用来发出指示，或用来征求对方的意见。例如：
We are to meet at the school gate at six.
我们定于6时在校门口集合。（计划、安排）
You are to hand in your compositions after class.
下课后你们必须交作文。（指示、命令）

10. In this way stories were passed on from one person to another.
pass on 传递。例如：

2) This custom has been passed down since the 18th century.
3) We cannot always observe the traditions passed down to us from the past.
我们不能总是固守过去传下来的传统。

三、阅读理解：
  Not only farmers but scientists have studied weather reporting. People for many centuries and in all countries have studied the weather and tried to make weather reports.
  Sometimes distant objects such as hills and tall trees seem to be very clear and near. This is a sing of much water-vapour in the air and therefore rain will probably come.
  When distant sounds are very clearly heard, then wet and stormy weather is on the way.
  Rings round the sun are a sign of coming rain.
  Many people feel in their bones the coming of wet weather. Their joints ache. Some birds fly high if fine weather is coming, but they fly very near the ground if rainy weather or a storm is on the way. This is because probably the insects, which they are hunting, then fly low.
  If you see a rainbow during rainy weather, this is a sign that the weather will clear up. Such rainbows always come in the evening. If the star twinkle clearly at night, then fair weather will continue. If a mist appears in the early morning, just about sunrise, the day will be warm.
  If the sunset is mostly red colour, then the following day will be fine. When big cumulous（积云的）clouds disappear at sunset, then the weather will follow on the next day.
  If cirrus clouds（卷云）remain quite still, then fine weather will come. If a rainbow appears in the morning, then rainy weather will probably come.
  Most of the above saying have been made up by people who have used their eyes and their brains to report the weather.
1. The text tells us  .
A. there are more than five signs of coming rain
B. there are at least five signs of coming rain
C. more signs of coming rain than that of good weather
D. there are as many signs as for both clear and rain
2. If we can't see distant tall tree nor hear the distant sounds clearly,  .
A. the coming days will be rainy weather
B. the strong wind blow the next day
C. we'll have a shining day
D. the weather will be the same as that day
3. If we see rainbow in the sky in the evening,  .
A. we may find the weather will clear up
B. then rainy weather will probably come
C. we are sure that it rained somewhere
D. we may know that the sun gives different kinds of colour rays
4. Both farmers and scientists have studied the weather  .
A. because of different purpose
B. through experience
C. to help them with their work
D. for hundreds of years
5. With the help of the text,  .
A. all of us can become a person of weather reporter
B. we'll know what weather will be the next few days
C. we are sure the weather report is very easy
D. we've learned a little in weather report
