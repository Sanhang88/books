   A boy walked along Carver Street, singing a sad song.He walked with his head down.Once he looked up and noticed the sign across the empty street, painted on the side of an old house.On the sign a big woman with yellow hair and a five - mile smile held out a big bottle."Coca - Cola.Drink Coca-Cola," the sign said.

  Joseph found the Bible, and,  50  the paper inside, laid it next to the bed.

A
  Have you ever got stuck with unwanted courses or a class schedule that cannot be changed? If so, that's because you don't know how to select the perfect schedule.But by following a few simple steps, you can begin any term with the right courses at the most convenient times.
  First, you must find the right courses.These are the ones that have the least amount of work, the fewest tests and the kindest professors.Ask your friends about courses in which they received A's after attending only 70 percent of the classes.Ask around, too, to see which instructors have given the same tests for the last fifteen years.Photocopies of these tests are usually cheap and can be easily found in school.Then, pick up a copy of the master schedule and study it carefully.Find the course titles that mean an easy pass for a painless subject.Look for titles like "Arts and Crafts for Beginners," and "Rock Music of the 1950s."
  Next, when you have got lists of easy instructors and subjects, you can begin to select your time periods.If you stay up late in order to watch old movies, you may want a daily schedule that begins no sooner than noon.You should schedule only afternoon courses, too, if you're one of those people who hate to leave a warm bed in the morning.On the other hand, if you are a person who gets out of bed at dawn, you may want to get your classes out of the way as early as possible.That way you have the rest of the day free.Morning classes are also necessary if you are a soap opera(肥皂剧) fan.
  Finally, you want your schedule to pass through registration successfully.The main way to do this is to register(注册) early.If a course does happen to be closed because you simply couldn't register at 7:00 a.m., you may still be able to get in.Talk to the professor and tell him or her that a serious and hardworking student like yourself would be a shining example to other students.Be sure to carry a list of backup courses to registration, though, just in case one of your chosen classes changes professors or time periods.
  By following these suggestions, any student can pick the perfect class schedule.College can thus become an almost pleasant activity.
56.Which of the following statements is true?
A.You can get copies of tests if you are willing to pay the price.
B."Rock Music of the 1950s" may be an easy course.
C.It is difficult to pick the perfect class schedule.
D.Attendance is required in all classes.
57.You should  .
A.register for classes in the morning if you get up early
B.have classes late in the morning if you stay up late
C.sign up for afternoon classes if you want to see soap operas
D.choose classes in the evening if you want to watch old films
58.If a course happens to be closed, you should  .
A.register at 7:00 a.m.
B.sit in on the class anyway
C.register for a backup course
D.get help from the professor
59.Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
A.Course Registration Made Easy
B.How to Find the Right Courses
C.Classes and After-class Activities
D.How to Pick the Perfect Schedule

  Lateral thinking(迂回思维), first described by Edward de Bono in 1967, is just a few years older than Edward's son.You might imagine that Caspar was raised to be an adventurous thinker, but the de Bono name was so famous, Casspar's parents worried that any time he would say something bright at school, his teachers might ask, "Where do you get that idea from?"
  "We had to be careful and not overdo it," Edward admits.Now Caspar is at Oxford--which once looked unlikely because he is also slightly dyslexic(诵读困难).In fact, when he was applying to Oxford, none of his school teachers thought he had a chance."So then we did several thinking sessions," his father says, "using my techniques and, when he went up for the exam, he did extremely well." Soon after, Edward de Bono decided to write his latest book, "Teach Your Child How to Think", in which he transforms the thinking skills he developed for brainstorming businessmen into informal exercises for parents and children to share.
  Thinking is traditionally regarded as something carried out in a logical sequence, and everybody knows that children aren't very logical.So isn't it an uphill battle, trying to teach them to think? "You know," Edward de Bono says, "If you examine people's thinking , it is quite unusual to find faults of logic.But the faults of perception are huge! Often we think ineffectively because we take too limited a view."
  "Teach Your Child How to Think" offers lessons in perception improvement, of clearly seeing the implications of something you are saying and of exploring the alternatives.
60.What is true about Caspar?
A. He is Edward's son.
B.He is an adventurous thinker.
C.He first described lateral thinking.
D.He is often blamed by his teacher.
61.It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that Edward ______.
A.was likely to improve children's logic with his book
B.gave a description of lateral thinking several years after his son was born
C.was prompted to study lateral thinking because his son was slightly dyslexic
D.once taught businessmen how to think before he wrote for parents and children
62.According to Paragraph 3, which of the following statements expresses Edward de Bono's view?
A.Everybody knows that children aren't very logical.
B.It is an uphill battle trying to teach children to think.
C.We often think ineffectively because we take too limited a view.
D.Thinking is traditionally regarded as something executed in a logical sequence.
63.Lateral thinking refers to the following EXCEPT_______.
A.improving one's logic in thinking
B.improving one's perception in thinking
C.seeing the implication of what you are saying
D.exploring the alternatives for what you are saying

  Life and the English language are getting more and more complicated.To take just one example--many people today live together and choose not to get married.This has become accepted by most people, but the English language, like a fussy old grandmother, hasn't quite got used to the idea.How, for example, do you introduce the person you are living with?
  "Let me introduce you to my man/woman?" I'm afraid that won't do.It sounds as though you are introducing a man-servant or a cleaning lady.Well, what about "my boy/girl friend"? That seems all right, but you're introducing someone who is thirty or forty, it sounds rather ridiculous(荒谬可笑)."My friend", then; OK, but it doesn't give the full picture, does it? You are more than just friends.And if you say "We're just good friends", people will scream with laughter and immediately assume you are having an extremely passionate(多情的)affair, and want to hide it.But what if you are having an extremely passionate affair and what people to know about it?
  You might think you could bravely throw back your head and announce in a loud voice: "This is John/Mary, he/she's my lover." Well, you could if you wanted to.Some people might even admire you for your courage, but everyone would assume that you were married to someone else, and were introducing the third party(第三者)who would soon be cited(传讯)in the divorce courts.So what about saying "This is the man/woman I live with"? Well, for a start, is takes too long to say.Secondly, It's too impersonal.
  Now you're really getting desperate, and start saying the first thing that comes into your head: "My common-law wife/husband"(no, that's too legalistic[墨守成规的]), "my partner"(that makes you think of a dancing partner), "my chick.my birds" (women aren't birds!), "my bloke, my fellah"(too slangy[俚语的])… Then finally you have a brainwave.Why not simply introduce your partner by his or her fist name? "Hello everybody, let me introduce you to John/Mary." A brilliant solution.Why didn't you think of it before? You've solved the problem.
  Or have you…? What if something like this occurs:
  You: Well, goodbye everybody, John/Mary is waiting for me outside.
  Another: Oh, who's John/Mary?
  You: Oh, John/Mary, he/she's my, er, man/woman, no, my boy/girlfriend, I mean my friend, I mean…
  Do you see what I mean? Whatever social changes are made in the future you can be sure that the grandmotherly English language will forbid you to find a word to describe them.
64.The author of this passage compares the English language to a fussy old grandmother because________.
A.the English language has a long history
B.the English language is often used to describe small things
C.the English language has a female character
D.the English language is conventional and hasn't got used to the idea of people living together without getting married
65.What does "a brainwave" in paragraph 4 mean?
A.a good, original idea which suddenly comes to mind.
B.an electrical force that can be measured.
C.a physical phenomenon.
D.a movement of the brain in waving.
66.What does the author of this passage mean after all?
A.He means to say that he has found a solution to the problem.
B.The difficulty can be overcome by introducing your partner by his or her first name.
C.Social changes will be made in the future but you will not be able to find a term in the grandmotherly English language for the description of such changes.
D.people should properly get married instead of living together by common law.
67.Which sentence summarizes the central idea of this passage?
A.The 1st sentence in paragraph 1.
B.The last sentence in the last paragraph.
C.The 2nd sentence in paragraph 1.
D.There's no central idea in this passage.
D
  In East Africa there is a tribe(部落)of people called the Masai.They are tall and slim(苗条的)and carry long spears to guard their cattle against an attacking lion or leopard(豹).There Africans move from place to place on the rolling(绵延起伏的)grasslands looking for suitable grazing(牧场)and water.Mboto is twelve years old.He helps his father drives the cattle.If the family decides to remain in one spot for a while, he helps gather sticks and thin branches to build a simple house.The sticks are placed in the ground in a circle.They are then bent inwards and joined at the top.Small branches and leaves fill the spaces.If it looks as if the family will stay longer than usual, then the inside walls are often plastered with cattle manure(粪).For a door there is only a small opening to allow a person to enter.A thorn(刺)fence is built around the small house to keep cattle safe at night.Lions,leopards and hyenas(鬣狗)prowl(捕食)around after dark, so the cattle would be easy to get killed and eaten.
  When Mboto grows up into a man, he will become a true Masai warrior(勇士).He will have to join other warriors in strange custom of drinking blood.The blood is taken from the neck of one of their cattle.It is mixed with milk and together with meat, becomes the main food for the men.
  The Masai have lived this way for thousands of years.The only change that seems to have affected their lives is the use of the transistor radio.It is quite common to see a young warrior with a pair of earphones listening to music while he is with the cattle.
68.The underlined word "plastered" in the first paragraph means _______.
A.painted
B.covered all over
C.put up
D.dotted
69.It can be learned from the text that _______.
A.A Masai warrior drinks blood mixed with milk
B.Mboto is a strong Masai warrior
C.A thorn fence is built to keep the cattle out
D.The Masai has nearly a thousand years of history
70.Which of the following is NOT true according to the text?
A.The Masai wander over the rolling African grasslands.
B.A Masai's simple house has a small opening as a door to allow a person to enter.
C.A Masai's simple house is made of branches and strong sticks.
D.Modern inventions do not affect the Masai's lives at all.
71.In the text the writer doesn't tell us _____.
A.how the Masai live
B.how the Masai protect their cattle
C.how many Masai people there are together
D.how the Masai build simple houses

  When the girls were ready to leave, Ozturk asked them if they wanted a cold drink.He could give them some lemonade if they wished, he said.
  The girls accepted eagerly, and while they had their drinks, Ozturk asked them a lot of questions about their family and what they were doing in Turkey and how they liked his country.
  They answered politely, taking care not to say anything that might offend him.They had been repeatedly instructed by their parents to be careful about mentioning things to strangers that could be construed as offensive.As a matter of fact, although the girls had enjoyed seeing Istanbul, they much preferred to spend the summer holidays with their friends at the beach in England.
  When they had finished their drinks, Ozturk offered them another but they refused politely, explaining they had to get started back to the hotel.They wanted to be sure to be back before five.
  "Don't worry," Ozturk said."I'll drive you to your hotel."
  The girls said it wasn't necessary.They could get back by themselves if he would only give them directions to a bus.
  Ozturk insisted on taking them home.He had two little girls himself, he said, about their age.He would like to think an English father would do the same for them if they were lost in London.He poured them some more lemonade and told them he would get his car from the garage.He would be back in a few minutes and meanwhile they could enjoy their drinks.
  Ten minutes passed and Ozturk had not returned.The two girls began to get uneasy, alone in the club, which seemed very large with the empty tables and open dance floor.Elaine suggested that they leave.After all, she said, they had no real obligation to remain, and besides, they would never see the man again.
  Even as she said this, the door opened and Ozturk reappeared.He had someone else with him, a small dark man dressed in a wrinkled suit.
  The girls said they were ready to leave.They didn't like the way the small dark man stared at them.As Elaine and Jennifer moved toward the door, the small man blocked their way.
  In very good English he asked if they would like a tour of Istanbul.They explained they had already seen Istanbul with their parents.
  Ozturk now offered them another drink.This frightened the girls.It was obvious to them now that the two men were trying to keep them with them.Elaine said loudly that it was high time she and her sister were on their way to their hotel.
  The men exchanged some words in Turkish and then Ozturk asked Elaine if she had ever seen a real Turkish nightclub show.He told her he was inviting them for dinner and the show that evening.It would be a new and interesting experience for them, he promised.
  "We can't," Elaine said.Once more she explained that their parents were expecting them no later than five and that it was very necessary that they get going at once.If they didn't get back, she said pointedly, her parents would no doubt call the police.
72.The girls got the drinks, _________
A.when talking with Ozturk.
B.when Ozturk asked them if they were to leave.
C.when Ozturk offered them before they were to leave.
D.when visiting Ozturk's club.
73.While drinking, the 2 girls _______
A.were talking with Ozturk politely.
B.were explaining that they had to get back to their parents.
C.felt relieved because Ozturk "offered" to drive them to their hotel.
D.told Ozturk that they enjoyed seeing Istanbul.
74.Arrange the following facts in order of time.
  a. Ozturk offered the girls drinks.
  b. The girls visited Istanbul.
  c. Ozturk "offered" to drive the girls back to their hotel.
  d. Ozturk went to "get" his car.
  e. A small man arrived with Ozturk.
  f. The 2 girls got to Ozturk's club and met him.
A.a f b c e d
B.f b a c d e
C.b f a c d e
D.b a d c e f
75.When did the girls tell the men their parents would call the police if they didn't turn up in time?
A.When Ozturk asked them to stay for the night show.
B.When Ozturk and the man were talking in Turkish.
C.When Ozturk offered them a third drink.
D.When they found the men would keep them in the club.
