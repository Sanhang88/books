【重点知识讲解】
Unit 20
1. Hopefully tomorrow will turn out fine.
1) 此句可转换为It is hoped that it'll become fine tomorrow.
hopefully = it is to be hoped that …. 例如：
Hopefully our teacher will be back today.
希望老师今天能回来。
Hopefully our class will win the competition.
希望我们班会赢这场比赛。
2) turn out 结果是……，最后情况是……，后面需跟adj / to do / that从句，不可用被动语态。例如：
It was raining this morning, but it turned out fine.
今天上午下雨，但后来晴天了。
The accident turned out to be a good thing.
这个事故最后变成了好事。
It turned out that the message sent to him was not correct. 结果是送到他那的消息是不对的。
2.I've always dreamt of coming to China, and now my dream has come true.
1) dream of 梦想，向往，渴望解如：
The boy dreamed of becoming a scientist.
那孩子一心想成为一名科学家。
dream of 用于否定句，表示"没想到"例如：
I never dreamt of seeing you here.
我从没想到在这儿见到你。
2) come true （希望、理想）等实现、达到。例如：
My wish to be a teacher has come true.
3. How do you manage in your wheelchair?
manage (vt) "设法完成（某件困难的事）"。后面多跟不定式to do.
例如：
He managed to escape from the fire.
他终于没法从大火中逃了出来。
She managed to finish her work in time.
她设法及时完成了工作。
manage vi 能办到，没法解决…… 例如：
① -Can I carry the box for you?
   -No, thanks. I can manage.
② I'll be able to manage without help.
4. But I'm determined to enjoy myself as much as possible, even though I can't see everything.
even though = even if "即使，纵然"。例如：
① She won't leave the TV set, even though her husband is waiting for his supper.
② Even though you disagree with her, she's worth listening to.
即使你不同意她的意见，她也是值得一听的。
5. So fas as I know you shouldn't have any problems here.
so (as) far as "表示程度、范围"作"就……；尽……；至于"解。as far as I know "就我所知"。例如：
So far as I know he has gone to America.
So far as I know there will be an English film this Saturday.
6. It's a pleasure. 别客气。
相当于It's my pleasure or My pleasure.
注意区别With pleasure 和My pleasure 当别人请你帮忙，你欣然同意，可以说With pleasure. 你帮了人家忙，人家谢谢你。这时要用My pleasure.
7. That is because this professor has a disease which prevents him form speaking.
prevent (sb) from (doing sth); stop (sb) from doing sth "使某人不做某事"，有时from 可省略，而构成prevent sb doing sth 结构，例如：
We must prevent them from making trouble.
我们必须防止他们捣乱。
The heavy rain prevented her (from) coming.
大雨使她来不了了。
8. Not only does he have to type out the answer on a computer, but he also gets the computer to translate it into sounds.
含有否定意义的副词和连词如not, not only, never, little, seldom, hardly 等放在句子的开头时，需用倒装语序。如：
① Never in my life have I seen such a thing.
我一生中从没有见到过这种事。
② Not a single mistake did he make.
③ Not until the meeting was over did he come.
④ Hardly had I reached there when it began to rain.
以上句子都是部分倒装，即谓语的助动词提到主语的前面。如果谓语全部提到主语前，则是全部倒装。例如：
① By the window stood an old man. He seemed very sad.
② In came the teacher, with a book in his hand.
③ From a speaker on the wall comes the doctor's voice: "Good morning."
9. As a matter of fact, many people have a disability.
as a matter of fact (really; in fact) "事实上，其实"。
例如：
① As a matter of fact, he is my husband..
② As a matter of fact, he felt even worse.
实际上他感到更难受了。
10. Even if none of this is true for us today, it is probable that one day we will end up with a disability.
1) Even if none of this is true for us today. =Even if we haven't any kind of the above mentioned disabilities today.
2) We will end up with a disability = We will have a disability in the end.
end up with "以……结束"。例如：
The class ended up with a song. 那节课是以一首歌结束的。
He ended up his letter with good wishes to the family.
他以对全家的祝福结束他的话。
11. People often think that disabilities are total.
此句可改变为People often think that those who have disabilities must be completely disabled.
total "全部的，完成的"。例如：
The total number of the students in our school is 1500.
total (n.) 总数，全体。Vi 合计。totally (adv) 例如：
We have a total of 110 teachers. 我们总共有110名老师。
The cost totaled up to $100. 费用合计一百美元。
He became almost totally blind. 他几乎完全瞎了。
12. Although he had a disease of the brain which was getting worse, he decided to continue with his research and his writing.
continue with (sth ) 作"继续（干某事）"解。此处continue 是不及物动词。例如：
① Though he met with many difficulties, he continued with his research work.
② Please continue with your discussion while I'm out.
③ The bad weather continued for several weeks.
continue vt 继续干某事。continue sth / to do sth / doing sth 例如：
She decided to continue her studies at home.
You should continue to improve your spoken English.

三、阅读理解：
  The train was gradually filled up with peasants travelling to market and they were ready for the journey, their bags full of bread, cakes, and coffee bottles for the thirty miles ahead.
  Outside the window, we saw fast express buses heading in the same direction. As They were passing up so quickly that we could not even read their destination boards. We were not quite reading selcok when a very important official entered the compartment and asked to see our tickets and then clipped (剪票) them. He was holding a railway time table which showed on its cover a colored photograph of a shining truck racing at a top speed over a long beautiful bridge that carried the railway across a deep valley. It was 3:05 P.m and raining when we pulled into Selcok. I say "pulled into" because we never actually stopped at Selcok. The train slowly passed the end of the platform and then we all threw ourselves out, peasants, soldiers and several railway men.
  We had to walk down a road and into the main entrance to get back to the platform, where a pretty little schoolgirl-- the daughter of a local railway official told us in French that the last train back to Lzmir would leave in just fifty-five minutes' time. That took a load off my mind.

4. When the passengers got off the train at Selcok, they did so   .
A. quickly, putting speed before safety
B. difficultly, getting wet all over
C. slowly, taking their time
D. easily, talking and laughing
5. Which of the following CANNOT be concluded from the passage?
