  BAGHADA (Reuters )-Iraq urged Arabs on Monday to seek martyrdom (殉难)by attacking U.S.forces in Kuwait ,saying the Americans were preparing to occupy Iraq .
  "We in Iraq and in the entire ( Arab ) nation believe that every faithful Arab has the right ,duty ,and the honor to deal with these forces in Kuwait", a spokesman was replying to the comments by al-Attiya ,Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ),in which he turned down an apology by president Saddam Hussein to the Kuwaiti people for the 1990 invasion .
  Saddam apologized Saturday for his 1990-1991 invasion of the country , but scolded Kuwait rulers for conspiring (同谋)with Washington against the Baghdad government .
  Kuwait turned down the apology and said Saddam's message amounted to "incitement (煽动)for terrorism ".
  The Iraq spokesman said "Does Attiya not know that the U.S.forces occupy Kuwait , start from there to destroy the Iraq and kill the Iraqis , and that the U.S.army forces plan to occupy Iraq ?"
  The GCCis made up of Kuwait , Saudi , Arabian , United Arab Empires , Qatar , Bahrain and Oman .
  UAE Information Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zaid al-Nahayan said Saddam's speech had cost Baghdad what support it had left in the Arab world .
  "I believe the speech cost the Iraq leadership any pity it had left and further proved the weakness of Iraq's political and media credibility (可靠性)at a time when Iraq needs to try its best to get rid of the threat of a face off ," sheikh Abdullah told the official Kuwait News Agency .
  Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug .2, 1990 .U.S.- led united forces drove the Iraq army from the oil-rich state in February , 1991.
  Thousands of U.S.troops have been sent to Kuwait since the 1991 Gulf War .However , these forces have been attacked several times in recent weeks .At least one U.S.soldier has died .

  Foxes and farmers have never got on well .These small dog-like animals have long been scolded for killing farm animals .They are officially regarded as harmful and farmers try to keep their numbers down by shooting or poisoning them .
  Farmers can also call on the services of their local hunt to control the fox population .Hunters hunt a fox across the countryside , with a group of specially trained dogs , followed by men and women riding horses .When the dogs finally catch the fox they kill it or a hunter shoots it .
  People who take part in hunting think of it as a sport ; they wear a special uniform of red coats and white trousers , and follow strict rules of behavior .But owning a horse and hunting regularly is expensive , so most hunters are wealthy .
  It is estimated that up to 100,000 people watch or take part in fox hunting .But over the last couple of decades the number of people who object to fox hunting , because they think it is cruel , has risen sharply .Nowadays it is rare for a hunt to pass off without some kind of confrontation (冲突)between hunters and hunt saboteurs (阻拦者).Sometimes these incidents lead to violence ,but mostly saboteurs interfere with the hunt by misleading riders and disturbing the trail of the fox's smell , which the dogs follow .
  Noisy confrontations between hunters and saboteurs become so common that they are almost as much a part of hunting as the hunting of foxes itself .But this year supporters of fox hunting face a much bigger threat to their support .A labor Party Member of the Parliament , Mike Foster , is trying to get parliament to pass a new law which will make the hunting of wild animals with dogs illegal (非法的).If the law is passed , wild animals like foxes will be protected under the ban in Britain .

  As many as one thousand years ago in the Southwest, the Hopi and Zuni Indians of North America were building their homes.Their homes looked like modern flats.Some were four stories high and contained quarters for perhaps a thousand people, along with store rooms for grain and other good.These buildings were usually put up against cliffs, both to make construction easier and for defense against enemies.They were really villages in themselves, as later Spanish people must have realized since they called them "pueblos", which is Spanish for town.
  The people of the pueblos raised what are called "the three sisters"-corns, beans, and squash.They made excellent pottery and baskets, some so fine that they could hold water.The Southwest has always been a dry country, where water is scarce.The Hopi and Zuni brought water from streams to their fields and gardens through channels.Water was so important that it played an important part in their area.
