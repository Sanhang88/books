初中英语第二册第十一单元
1．本单元中心话题：本单元主要涉及的教学内容是"日期和月份（Dates and months）"及"季节（seasons）"这两个话题。
2．语法内容：反意疑问句、与时间搭配的介词in、on和at
3．语音：字母组合n, kn, ng, nk, th的读音规则
【重点归纳】
1．星期和日期的表达：
询问星期：What day is it today?
It's Sunday / Monday …
从星期天到星期六分别为：
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
询问日期：What's the date today?
It's …
日期的表达有两种：一般为先月份后日期。如：
五月二十八日：May 28 / May 28th读：May the twenty-eighth
另一种为先日期后月份。如：
五月二十八日：28 May / 28th May读： the twenty-eighth of May
年份都放在最后。
2．与时间搭配的介词in、on和at
我们很早就学习了in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, at night, on Monday，等由介词引导的时间状语。我们在记住这些习惯用语的同时，要注意介词的正确运用。
首先，在那天，英语是on that day。即在某一天是用介词on来表示的。例如：
in the morning - on Monday - on Monday morning
in the afternoon - on October 1st - on the afternoon of October 1st.
in the evening - on Mid-Autumn Day - on the evening of Mid-Autumn Day
第二，tomorrow night前面不加介词。同样地，tomorrow morning, tomorrow afternoon和tomorrow evening，均不加介词。还有，today, tonight, this morning, this afternoon, this evening等也都不加介词。
第三，在一般情况下at表示在某时某刻，on表示在某一天，in表示在某一周、某一月、某一年等。但是，在连续的几天里用in；在不连续的几天里用on。如：
in those days, on Sundays, on cold winter days等。
3．本单元出现的常用句型：
a)What day is it today?
b)What is the date today? / What date is it today?
c)What's the weather like …? / How's the weather …?
d)When is + season + in China?
e)Which is the + 序数词 + month of the year?
4．反意疑问句
反意疑问句由陈述句加上一个简单的提问构成。他要求：
前面是肯定陈述句，后面加简略问句的否定式；前面是否定陈述句时，后面用肯定的省略疑问句形式。如：
John studies very hard, doesn't he?
There isn't any student in the classroom, is there?

【学习方法和难点】
1．谈论天气
a)询问天气：
i.What is the weather like today?
How's the weather today?
今天天气怎样？
ii.What does the weather forecast / report say?
天气预报怎么说的？
iii.A lovely day, isn't it?
天气真好，不是吗？
iv.What's the temperature today, do you know?
你知道今天的气温吗？
v.What's the climate like here?
这里的气候怎么样？
b)预测天气：
i.It is going to rain.
天要下雨了。
ii.I don't think the rain would last long.
我想这场雨不会持续多久。
iii.It seems to be clearing up.
天似乎在转晴。
iv.The fog is starting to lift.
雾开始消散了。
v.The wind's rising.
起风了。
vi.The wind's getting up. / The wind's going down.
风越刮越大。/ 风开始减弱。
2．反意问句的注意点：
a)陈述句的否定判断。除了谓语动词是否定形式外，句子含有表示否定意义的副词、不定代词等，也当作否定句。这些词常见的有：
no, nothing, never, nobody, no one, none, neither, hardly, little, few等。
b)省略问句的主语用代词而不是名词，并要和陈述句的主语保持一致。
c)前后两部分的助动词、情态动词或动词在时态、人称和数上要保持一致。
d)省略问句中的not要用简略形式。
3．The weather gets warmer, and the days get longer. / Trees turn green.
以上句子中的get和turn都用作连系动词。意为"变得"。后跟形容词。如：get older, get bigger等。
4．动词need的形式变化
动词need即可作为情态动词使用，也可作为行为动词使用。
后面跟动词时，可说need do，也可说need to do。其变化形式分别如下：
情态动词：need doneedn't doNeed + 主语 + do …
行为动词：need to dodo not need to doDo +主语 + need to do …
后面跟名词时，是行为动词。

四、书面表达：
Thank you for the pretty present you sent to me for my birthday. You asked me about the weather here in my hometown. The weather here is not too cold nor too hot. In spring, everything begins to grow. The weather becomes warmer, but strong winds often come in this season. Many people like spring here.
In summer, it is usually very hot. But it is a good season for swimming. I like to go swimming with my classmates. We have a long summer holiday. At that time I can go swimming in the lake near my town.
Autumn is a good season. It is the best time for you to visit here.
In winter it is cold. But it is not so cold for us to go skating. It's unlucky.
Please write to me soon.
