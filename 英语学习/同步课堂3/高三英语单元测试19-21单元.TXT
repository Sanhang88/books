  "There is a senseless notion that children grow up and leave home when they're 18, and the truth is far from that,"says sociologist Larry Bumpass of the University of Wisconsin.Today, unexpected numbers of young adults are living with their parents." There is a major shift in the middle class," declares sociologist Allan Schraiberg of Northwestern University, whose son, 19, moved back in after an absence of eight months.
  Analysts cite a variety of reasons for this return to the nest.The marriage age is rising, a condition that makes home and its pleasantness particularly attractive to young people.A high divorce rate and a declining remarriage rate are sending economically pressed and emotionally hurt survivors back to parental shelters.For some, the expense of an away-form-home college education has become so excessively great that many students now attend local schools.Even after graduation, young people find their wings clipped by skyrocketing housing costs.
  A mother says," It's ridiculous for the kids to pay all that money for rent.It makes sense for kids to stay at home." But sharing the family home requires adjustments for all.There are the hassles over bathrooms, telephones and privacy.Some families, however, manage the delicate balancing act.But for others, it proves too difficult.Michelle Del Turco, 24, has been home three times-and left three times," What I considered a social drink, my dad considered an alcohol problem," she explains." He never liked anyone I dated, so I either had to hide away or meet them at friends' house"
  Just how long should adult children live with their parents before moving on? Most psychologists feel lengthly homecomings are a mistake.Many agree that brief visits, however, can work beneficially.

A.young adults left their parents and lived independently
B.with the marriage rising, young adults spent more time living with their parents

  Animals seem to have the sense of eating when they are hungry and they do not eat more than their bodies need.It had been demonstrated that rats will, when given a choice over a period of time, prefer water with vitamins to water without vitamins, even though there is no difference in taste or smell between the two water bottles.When a fragrant flavor was added to the vitamin, enriched liquid, the rats did seem to develop a taste for it and kept drinking it, even after the vitamins were switched to the clear water.In time, however, they broke" the habit" and went back to where the necessary vitamins were.
  In an experiment, babies of 6 to 12 months old were placed in a cafeteria, with a wide selection of baby food before them.They were given whatever food they pointed to or appeared interested in.We are told that at first they showed some unusual eating patterns, but over a period of time they managed to select a well-balanced diet.
  So, in selecting food, rats and babies do seem to know and act on what's best for them.Clearly, there is a kind of " body wisdom" which humans soon lose.Most of us do not eat as wisely as we could .Some people eat foxes ,dogs ,and black birds .while we eat cows and pigs .So what people eat and how much they eat seem to be greatly influenced by what is going on around them .

  There is an unknown thing in every theatre presentation: the direct contact between artist and spectator, Even with the same script, setting and performers, a play differs from night to night.Not only do the performer's attitudes and actions change, but the audience changes as well.Each audience differs form the next; each brings new expectations and attitudes.The result is a different flow between the stage and auditorium.For artists and performers alike, this aspect of going to the theatre is most striking.Often in the final stages of rehearsal a show is technically perfect but lacks life.In most cases, fortunately, the audience supplies the sparkle.Spectators often are surprised to hear this fact.Many of them believe that a production will be the same each time, except that it may continue slightly to improve.This is not the case at all: The performers need the response from the audience as much as the audience needs the flow from the actors.Many times a performer or technician will refer to a " dead house" or ask" Was anyone really out there?" The size of an audience affects the flow of communication to a certain degree, but even two audiences of the same size will react much differently during two nights of a play's run.According to the late Noel Coward, a British actor and playwright." Sometimes you have an equal number of people, one night they're a lot of cod's heads, the next night they're marvelous; and you have to know how to handle them.If they are dull, then you've got to be a little quicker; if they're warm and very responsive, you've got to catch yourself, other wise they'll lead you astray and make you overplay.In fact, I believe that all acting is a question of control, the control of the actor of himself, and through himself of the audience."
1.According to the passage, the actors  .
A.never repeat the actions in the theatre presentations
B.are not allowed to change their actions in the performance
C.may change the actions according to the size of the stage
D.prefer to have the same kind and size of the spectators
2.According to the passage, often, in the final stage of the rehearsal,  .
A.the show doesn't look interesting, though technically perfect
B.performers find it difficult to contact with the audience
C.artists are free to make some changes on the scripts
D.the audience are not expected to be responsive to the show
3.By referring to a " dead house", the performer implies that  .
A.the audience are slow in giving their response
B.response is not needed from the audience at this time
C.he seems to be out of contact with the audience
D.no audience is present to watch the performance
4.According to the late Noel Coward, during the performance, the actor should  .
A.act in the same way before the two equal sized audiences
B.do his best to make the audience more response
C.be aware of the audience's attendance
