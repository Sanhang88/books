After sleeping for a short time，they had to play again．On the second night，they fell asleep as soon as they stopped．Some of them had trouble with their feet and hands， but the only serious problem was a psychological（心理上的）one． Each boy was thinking：why am I doing this？How can I play any longer？After the third night，the players knew they could finish the ninety hours．The basketball on the fourth night was very slow．But in the final hours，the players got bet- ter．For the last few minutes，the players looked as fresh as when they started．How happy everyone was！

The giraffe is the tallest modern land animal．It can be over 5．5 metres tall．Its neck alone may be 1．9metres long．Yet the giraffe has only seven bones（骨）in its neck，the same number as in the human（人类）．Even a small bird has many more bones in its neck than in a tall giraffe．Each bone in a giraffe's neck is very long，while the bones in a human's neck are small．That makes the difference．A female（雌性的） giraffe gives birth to one baby at a time．The baby，called a calf，is about 1．9metres tall at birth．By the age of eight it is fullgrown．The giraffe eats mostly leaves．Because it has a long neck，it can reach the leaves high up on the trees．
