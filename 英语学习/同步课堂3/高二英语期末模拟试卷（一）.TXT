   HONG  KONG - The Walt Disney Company might build a second theme park in China. But top executives have argued a report that Disney wants to build another one in Beijing in time for the 2008 Olympics.
   Disney has plans to build a Hong Kong park that is scheduled to open in 2005 or 2006. "Our job is to make the Hong Kong Disneyland work and be successful." Disney chairman and chief executive Michael Eisner said. He said the company might later build a second park in China, though he would not say where. "I'm sure someday there will be a possibility to build another Disney theme park that would be geographically so distant from Hong Kong that they will not compete."
   When Disney was in talks with Hong Kong about building the park here, officials in Shanghai made it clear they would rather have the park. Disney executives said they were concerned about border controls that could slow visitors from the Chinese mainland who want to come to the Hong Kong theme park. They also said they had raised the issue with Hong Kong and Beijing. Although Hong Kong was returned from Britain to China four years ago, strict border controls remain in place between the capitalist territory and the mainland.

( B )
   How do American babies get their names when they are born?
   We'd better know the formation of American names before we answer this question. A native American may have his name in two or three parts. Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, had his name in two parts. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President, had his name in three parts. The first part is the given name, or the first name. The second part is the middle name or middle names, as Delano in Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The last part is the family name, surname or the last name, as Reagan in Ronald Reagan.
   How does an American baby get his given name? Generally, when an American baby is born, the parents may pick up a name from a name book, or think of a name they like, and give it to the baby as the given name. Sometimes, the given name means something. If a girl baby's given name is Alice, then she is hoped to be noble or cheerful, because Alice means noble and of good cheer. If the parents give their daughter Linda as the first name, then the parents hope their daughter to be pretty or beautiful, because it means that. If a boy's given name is David, then he could be his parents' beloved one, because David means a beloved person. But sometimes, the given name is just a given name, and it doesn't mean anything. In another case, parents can give their baby the given name according to their hobby or desire.
   Then how do American babies get their middle names? We must take people's relationship into consideration when we answer this question. If the parents respect or hope to remember the grandparent, then they give their baby a middle name after the grandmother or grandfather. If the parents have a very close friend, they may pick their baby a middle name after their friend. Some parents name their baby after themselves.
   Some even give the baby a middle name according to a famous person. So a baby may have one or two or even more middle names if the parents wish.
   A baby gets his family name after his father's family name. If the father's family name is Smith, then the baby's family name will be Smith, too.
61) The underlined phrase "in another case" means _______.
a. for another example
b. on the contrary
c. in addition
d. in case
62) From the name "Linda Smith" we know that _______.
a.It's a girl
b.Her parents' names are Smith.
c.Her parents want her to be pretty or beautiful
d.All the above
63) Which of the following sentences shows the main idea of this passage?
a.How do American babies get their names when they are born?
b.We'd better know the formation of American names.
c.Sometimes the given name doesn't mean anything.
d.Parents give their baby the given name according to their hobby or desire.
64) In the American name "Franklin Delano Roosevelt", "Roosevelt" is the _______.
   Which is wrong?
a. family name
b. surname
c. last name
d. given name
65) Which of the following is true about American names?
a.Each American name has 3 parts: the first name, the middle name and the last name.
b.A baby's given name is usually the same as his/her grandparent.
c.Parents may pick up a name for the baby after their friend has found one.
d.A baby may have 2 or 3 middle names.

   You can use your Business Telecard International at any card phone in the UK. Here is some information about making international phone calls.
   You can now phone almost any country in the world, although in some cases you can only call major cities. When you cannot make direct dialing calls, you can ask the international operator to help you. This is more expensive and takes more time, but it may be helpful if you want to speak to a particular person and no one else; in this case you should ask for a "person-to-person" call. Even more expensive is a reverse charge call where the person who receives the call pays.
   If the international line is busy, you can reserve a call; explain the number you want and the operator will call you back when the line is free.
   You can save money by calling outside office hours, e.g. early in the morning, late at night, and on Sundays.
   Remember that the time may be different in the country you are calling. International time is based on GMT (Greenwich Mean Time); London is on GMT and Moscow, for example, is 3 hours ahead.
   There is one problem: change to DST (Daylight Saving Time) for the Summer. In the UK, clocks are put forward one hour in Spring and put back in Autumn, and so London is actually one hour ahead of GMT in the Summer.
   You can use your Business Telecard International for domestic calls as well, but there will be an additional charge over the standard rate.
71) What is "a reverse charge call"?
a.An international call.
b.A very expensive call.
c.A call for which the person who receives the call pays.
d.A call to major cities.
72) What is the most expensive type of call?
a. direct dial.
b. through the operator.
c. reverse charge call.
d. calling outside office hours.
73) According to the passage, what can you do if the international line is busy?
a. book a call.
b. make a "person-to-person" call.
c. call back outside office hours.
d. give up.
74) When is it cheaper to make an international call?
a. 10 a.m.
b. 4 p. m.
c. 11 p. m.
d. 3 hours ahead of GMT.
75) How many hours is Moscow ahead of London during the summer?
a. 1  b. 2
c. 3   d. 4
( E )
   Ali put the 10 bags in a row and took out one stone from the first bag, two stones from the second bag, three stones from the third, etc. He therefore had 55 stones altogether. If all stones weighed 1 gram, the total weight would be 55 grams. But he knew the real diamonds only weighed 0.8 grams each, 0.2 grams lighter than all other stones. So if the total weight was 54.8 grams, he could easily tell that the stone from the first bag was the real diamond. If the total weight was 54.6 grams, the stones from the second bag were the real diamonds. And if the total weight was 54 grams, no doubt the stones from the fifth bag were real diamonds. In this way he could find the bag containing real diamonds with no trouble at all.
   Ali the thief had managed to break into the Sultan's treasure room. He was looking for a bag containing 1250 diamonds, each weighing 0.8 grams. Unfortunately, the Sultan had filled nine other bags with imitation diamonds. There were 1000 imitation diamonds in each bag, each one weighing 1 gram. So all 10 bags weighed exactly 1000 grams and all the bags looked exactly alike. Just as Ali was wondering, the Sultan came into the room with his guards. The Sultan arrested Ali but did not kill him immediately. He gave Ali a chance to save his life. This is what the Sultan said to Ali: "If you can find the bag containing the real diamonds by using these scales (秤)just once, you may keep the diamonds. If not, you will be killed. You can take the stones from any of the bags and put them in other bags if you wish. But you can only weigh once on the scales."
76) Who was Ali?
a. A servant of Sultan.
b. A thief.
c. A weigher.
