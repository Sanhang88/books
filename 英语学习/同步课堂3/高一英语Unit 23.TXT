They went on holiday last week.
2、They are now at breakfast, talking about the plan for their trip.
be at breakfast 正在吃早饭
句中的talking about the plan for their trip作状语，表示伴随动作，有"边吃饭，边谈论"的意思。又如：
I lay in bed, reading an interesting story.
3、I'd prefer to do that tomorrow, I don't feel like walking very much today.
would prefer表示"较喜欢"，"宁愿"。例如：
1)Which would you prefer, tea or coffee?
2)I have a lot to do today but I'd prefer to do it tomorrow.
3)I would prefer to wait until dark.
我宁愿等到天黑。
feel like doing想做某事。feel是动词，like是介词，后接名词或动词-ing形式，不能接不定式。如：
I feel like having a talk with her.
I don't feel like going out for a walk now.
注意：feel like可用于各种句子，而would prefer一般只用于肯定句或疑问句，不用于否定句。不宜说成I wouldn't prefer to go out for a walk now.
4、Can't we visit the High Dam?  我们去看大坝好吗？
这是一种否定疑问句，常用缩写开头，如Can't, Don't, Won't 等用来提出邀请或征求意见，这种疑问句常表示得到肯定回答。
例如：
Won't you have some more chicken?
再吃点鸡肉好吗？
Can't you join us in playing football?
Don't you think it's a funny story?
5、It's on the edge of the lake that has been made by the dam.
on the edge of   在……的边缘
It's dangerous to sit on the edge of the well.
坐在井边很危险。
6、Also, around the area of Aswan there are a lot of important old temples, which date from about 1250 BC.
date from / date back to 起始于，追溯到，这一短语没有被动语态，常用一般现在时。
Her interest in playing the piano dates from her childhood.
她弹琴的兴趣是从孩提时代开始的。
This sort of dress dates back to the Tang Dynasty.
这种衣服可追溯到唐代。
which date from about 1250 BC.是一个非限制性定语从句，关系代词之前用逗号，使从句与主句分开。例如：
He married a poor girl, which made his parents angry.
他娶了一个穷姑娘，使得他的父母很生气。
He had two sons, neither of whom was kind to him.
他有两个儿子，没一个对他好的。
There are two machines, both of which were made in Germany.
这里有两台机器都是德国造的。
7、These temples were in danger.
in danger处在危险中，dangerous危险的。
He fell down onto the ground from the top of a three-storeyed building and he has been in danger now.
他从三层楼顶掉在地上，现在还未脱险。
dangerous危险的
It's dangerous to swim in the river alone.
独自在这条河中游泳是很危险的。
8、In all, 1700 workers and 200 other people worked on the project.
in all 或in total作"总共"解，在句子中作状语。例如：
There were twenty in all at the party.
参加这次聚会的总共有20人。
The cost of the project amounts in total to 25000 US dollars.
这项工程的费用总计25000美元。
work on 忙于，从事于做什么，例如：
He has been working on / at a new novel for over a year.
一年多时间以来，他一直在写一部新小说。
He is working on / at a physics problem.
他正在解一道物理题。
9、All the visitors who go there believe that it was right that the temple was rescued.
去那儿参观的人都认为拯救这座寺庙是做得对的。
这是一个复合句。All the visitors …… believe ……是主句。在visitors后跟一个定语从句who go there;在believe 后跟一个由连词that 引起的宾语从句，而这个宾语从句中的it是形式主语，真正的主语是后面的that从句that the temple was rescued。
10、Inside the temple is a row of stone animals, which face the rising sun.
face 是及物动词，作"面对"，"朝着"，"正视"解。例如：
Our house faces street.
我们的房子朝着大街。
He turned and faced Mrs Smith.
他转过身来，面对着史密斯太太。
We must face the difficulties and overcome them.
我们必须正视困难，克服困难。

On the way there I   20  thinking of my future work. It seemed to me that I was   21   the top of the world.

三、阅读理解：
  The news media in the United States consist of radio, television and newspaper. They are everywhere in the lives of many Americans and have great influence on their activities. Many Americans begin their day reading the newspaper or watching a morning news program on television while drinking their coffee. While driving to work, the news is broadcast repeatedly on the radio and television. In the evening news is a main program on television with up to two hours of news in the early evening and more news late at night. For those who prefer reading ,the evening newspaper offers the readers the possibility of reading the news others see and hear on television.
  The news media in the US are free of government control. It is up to the general public to choose what to read, watch or listen to. Therefore, the media must meet the interests of the public, as each station or each paper competes for listeners and readers. Each tries to offer the news that Americans want to know. When an item becomes newsworthy, such as election or war, Americans will become familiar with the most recent details as the news media act quickly to be as informative as possible. But the result is that the news becomes repetitive. As the news media report the same news items which are estimated to be the most interesting and impressive, listeners, viewers, or readers might find it difficult to be selective. Yet, most Americans would not criticize their news media too severely. The function of the news media is generally understood and accepted by the American public.
