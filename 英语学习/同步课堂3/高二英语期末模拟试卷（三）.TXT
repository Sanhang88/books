  A linguist, an expert on languages, is always listening , never off-duty. I invited a group of friends found to my house, telling them that I was going to record their speech, I said I was interested in their regional accents, and that it would take only a few minutes. Thus, one evening, three people came of my house and were shown into my front room. In front of each chair there was a microphone at head height, connected to a recorder in the middle of the floor. They sat down, rather nervously, and I explained that all I wanted was for them to count from one to twenty. Then we could relax and have a drink.
  I turned on the recorder and each turn counted from one to twenty in their best accents. When it was over, I turned the recorder off and brought round the drinks. The rest of the evening was spent in total relaxation. I joined them in talking and joking freely.
  leaving them only for a telephone call which lasted some time.
  Or at least that is how would appear. For, of course, the microphones were not connected to the recorder in the middle of the room at all but to another one in the bedroom. My friends, having seen the recorder before them turned off, paid no more attention to the microphones, a few inches from their mouths, thus giving excellent sound quality. It meant that I was able to get as natural a piece of talk as it would be possible to find.
  I should add perhaps, that I did tell my friends what had happened to them, after the recording was over, and asked them whether it should be destroyed. None of them wanted to-but for some. Linguistic research can be a very expensive business.
77．The writer asked his friends to count from one to twenty because he _________.
A．wanted to record how they pronounced numbers in their regional accents
B．had to check if his recorder was working
C．wanted them to think that was he wanted to record
D．wanted to discover who had the best pronunciation
78．The writer left the room in the middle of the evening because ________.
A．he had to make a phone call
B．the phone rang in bedroom
C．he wanted the others to have a talk without him
D．he didn't like talking with them
79．The recording which the writer was able to make was _________.
A．natural
B．controlled
C．unclear
D．.expensive
80．When he told his friends what he had done, they_______.
A．wanted him to destroy the recording he had made
B．didn't seem to mind much
C．were angry with him
D．made him buy them more drinks
81．The writer recorded their talk _________.

  Your mobile phone rings, and instead of the usual electronic signals, it's playing your favourite music. A friend sends your favourite song to cheer your up. One day, a record company might forward new records and videos to your phone.
  The mobile business is getting into the music business. For the moment, the interest is in pleasant ring tones, but some companies are hoping to take full advantage of the next generation of mobile phones-all-purpose gadgets(小玩意儿)that blend phone, personal stereo, video player and Internet browser into one.
  Finally, record companies might send new records and videos to fans who register (注册) their cell phone numbers.
  The fans could pass music or songs along to friends-a kind of musical trading card. Unlike Internet tracks, mobile downloads would be easy for record companies to control, said former record industry official Ralph Simon, who is now chairman of Yourmobile, based in Santa Monic, California.
  "If you pass a song along to other phones through a network, each phone can be charged,"said Simon. "It's  like going through a toll gate (收费站). There's more possibility for copyright control than there is on the Internet"
  Massachustts-based Converse is offering a service in Portugal and the Netherlands that lets people record tunes on their voice mail or send music as presents to friends. Finally, people might be able to sing karaoke and pass them along. The company is sure that people will want to use music to reach out and touch someone.
  "A mobile phone is not a listening machine, and you'll be disappointed if you think you can change it to a radio, " said Ohad Ouziel, a creative manager for converse in Israel. "But if someone sends you a song while you're on vacation, you appreciate the feeling."
82．The underlined word "blend" in the second paragraph most probably means _______.
A．send  B．become
C．mix  D．compare
83．"Massachusetts-based Converse " in the sixth paragraph probably refers to ________.
A．a person
B．a city in Israel
C．a state of the USA
D．a company
84．Record companies _______ the idea of passing songs and music along mobile phones.
A．are worried about
B．are interested in
C．try hard to stop
D．take no notice of
85．According to Ralph Simon it would be easier to ________ through mobile phone network than through the Internet.
A．protect copyright of music works
B．send personal messages
C．pass along songs and music
D．send voice mail
