  When you are learning English, you find   1   wrong to translate a sentence word for word into your   2   language. Take the sentence "How do you do?" as an   3  . If you look   4   each word in the   5  , one at a time, what is your  6  ? It must be a   7   sentence in your native language. Languages do not only have different sounds, they are also   8   in many other ways. It is very  9   to master the rules of word   10   in the study of English, too.

But sometimes they   17   say "Good morning!" or "Good afternoon!" or "Good evening!"  18   "Good night!" to one another   19   "Good-bye!" You will find few people  20   who know that "Good-bye!" is a short way of saying "God be with you!"

  The human nose has given to the language of the world many interesting expressions. Of course, this is not surprising. Without the nose, We could not breathe or smell. It is the part of the face that gives a person special character. Cyrano de Bergerac said that a large nose showed a great man-courageous, manly, and wise.
  A famous woman poet wished that she had two noses to smell a rose! Blaise Pascal made an interesting remark about Cleopatra's nose. If it had been shorter, he said, it would have changed the whole face of the world!
  Man's nose has had an important role in his imagination. Man has referred to the nose in many ways to express his emotions. Expressions dealing with the nose refer to human's weakness, anger, pride, jealousy and revenge┗┯苅.
  In English there are a number of phrases about the nose. For example, to hold up one's nose expresses a basic human feeling-pride. People can hold up their noses at people, things, and places.
  The phrase, to be led around by the nose, shows man's weakness. A person who is led around by the nose lets other people control him. On the other hand, a person who follows his nose lets his instinct┗渉棕guide him.

  In the water around New York is a very small island called Liberty Island. On it there is a very special statue called the Statue of Liberty. It is one of the most famous sights in the world.

The statue was built in France, taken apart piece by piece, and then rebuilt in the United States. It first opened to the public on October 28,1886.
