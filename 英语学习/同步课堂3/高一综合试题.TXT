第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题）
A
Are you carrying too much on your back to school? Lots of kids your age are. Not only are students in China suffering from the problem, but kids in the United States are puzzled by heavy school bags.
Experts are starting to worry that young students are having back and neck problems as a result of school bags being too heavy for them. It is hard for me to get up the stairs with my bag because it's so heavy, said Rick Hammond, an 11-year-old student in the US.
Rick is among the students who have regular backpacks(背包) with two straps (带子) to carry them, but a number of other students choose rolling backpacks. But even with rolling backpacks, getting up stairs and buses with them is still a problem for kids. Many of them have hurt their knees, backs or necks because of heavy school bags.
　 But how much is too much? Experts say students should carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their own body weight. Scott Bautch, a Wisconsin back doctor, said kids under 4th grade should stay with 10 percent, but it’s also important that older kids don’t go beyond (超出) 15 percent, because their bones are still growing.
Bautch explained that there are other injuries caused by backpacks. Kids are losing their balance and falling down with these backpacks, he said.
Parents and teachers are starting to tell kids to only take home library books they will be reading in the evening. Some teachers are using worksheets (作业单 ) or thin workbooks for students to take home.
One of the best answers is, as some kids suggest, to have no homework at all!

A. seek(寻找) ways to solve the problem of heavy bags
