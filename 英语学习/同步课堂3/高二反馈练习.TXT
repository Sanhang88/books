IV、阅读理解
( A )
 Professor Martin's report says that children who attend a number of different schools, because their parents have to move around the country, probably make slow progress in their studies. There are also signs, says Professor Martin, that an unusually large number of such children are mentally affected.
 Captain Thomas James, an army lecturer for the past 20 years and himself a father of two children, said, "I've never heard such rubbish. Taking me for example, no harm is done to the education of my children who change schools regularly―if they keep to the same courses, as in our army schools. In my experience―and I've known quite a few of them―army children are as well-adjusted as any others, if not more so.
 What the Professor doesn't appear to appreciate is the fact that in such situations children will change much better than grown-ups.
 When this was put to Professor Martin, he said that at no time had his team suggested that all such children were backward or mentally affected in some way, but simply that in their experience there was a clear tendency.
 “Our findings show that while the very bright child can deal with regular changes without banning his or her general progress in studies, the majority of children suffer from constantly having to enter a new learning situation.”
1. According to Professor Martin _____ are affected by constantly changing their schools.
A. few army children
B. only bright children
C. all the children

A. if army children are not more well-adjusted than the others

C. if more army children are not as well-adjusted any others
D. if there are not more children who can be well-adjusted
3. According to the passage, who thought that it was not good for children to change schools too often?
A. Captain James.
B. Professor Martin.
C. The writer of the passage.
D. Parents of the children.
4. Captain James holds the view that _____.
A. what the Professor said was right
B. the more schools children change, the less progress they will make
C. children can change much more easily than grown-ups
D. all backward children are greatly affected by changing schools
5. After hearing what Captain James said, Professor Martin _____.
A. agreed to his view
B. changed his own view immediately

  Since the earliest times, trees have always been very useful and important to man who made use of them in many ways for his daily life. Today trees continue to play a very important part in many ways. They provide man with fruits, fuel for burning, wood for building and furniture. You can imagine what would happen if there were no trees in the world in which we're living.
  In the tropics where it's very warm throughout the year, trees protect man from the heat of the hot sun. They are also very useful in protecting good and rich topsoil from being washed away, as there are many heavy rains there.
  Without trees and grass, heavy rains would wash away the rich surface soil which is so essential for agriculture. The result is that the land becomes useless and unproductive.
  There are many desert areas in the world, which used to be very rich and fertile areas. But people in ancient times cut down trees indiscriminately and no new trees were planted. When strong winds came, they blew away the rich surface soil and for this reason the land was turned into useless deserts where nothing could grow.
6. From the passage, we know _____.
A. some deserts were once fertile lands
B. some deserts were once poor and useless lands
C. deserts used to be covered by stones
D. deserts once were sea
7. Topsoil is _____.
A. good for raising animals
B. good for agriculture
C. useful for trees to grow
D. found only by the rivers
8. If there were no trees, _____.
A. the land would become dry
B. heavy rains would come
C. the rich topsoil could not be held back
D. the rain would be necessary for man
9. According to the passage, which of the following statements is wrong?
A. Man still depends on trees in his daily life.
B. Heavy rains and winds can cause the loss of the topsoil.
C. If people grow a certain number of trees, they can cut down trees as they will.
D. Trees can not only prevent the heat of the hot sun but also can keep soil from being washed away in the tropics.
10. A good title for this passage is _____.
A. Rich Land and Desert
B. Not Going against the Nature
C. The Importance of Trees
D. How to Prevent Soil Being Washed Away
(C )
 For years and years people have been saying that the railways are dead. “We can do without railways,” people say―as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line, and so does a train. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do.
 Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modem railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep in comfort, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are travelling at high speed at the same time? And we are only at the beginning. For we have just entered the age of super-fast trains, trains travelling at 150 miles an hour and more. Some will be wondering why we spent so much on motorways we can't use because we have not enough money to buy the oil and planes we can't fly in for the same reason.
11. Some people think the railways are unnecessary for many reasons except that
A. planes and motorcars have taken the place of trains
B. oil is expensive today
C. trains are slow
D. railways lose money
12. The writer's idea seems to be that _____.
A. we can do without railways
B. trains have much in common with motorcars and planes
C. trains are much slower than motorcars and planes, but they are cheaper
D. trains are as good as motorcars and planes
13. According to the writer, which of the following is NOT true?
A. It's cheaper to travel by train than by plane.
B. The railway station is usually at the center of a city.
C. When you get off the plane, you will find yourself right in the city center.
D. No motorcar or plane can carry as much as a train does.
14. The writer thinks that the railways, far from being dead, are very much alive because _____.
A. we can have a smooth and untroubled journey
B. we will not have enough money to fly in planes
C. we can now travel in super-fast trains
D. all the above
15. The best title for this passage may be _____.
A. Not the End, But the Beginning
B. Which is the Best: Train, Motorcar or Plane?
C. Trains Are More Competitive Than Motorcars or Planes
D. Super-fast Trains

(D )
 Weather has a strong effect on people. It influences health, intelligence, and feelings.
 In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is very hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in these states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March.
 The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during a storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can lower it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly on exams in the hot months of the year (July and August).
 Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65°F, people become stronger.
 Low air pressure makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetfulness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low-pressure days. There is a “perfect weather” for work and health. People feel best at a temperature of about 64°F with 65 percent humidity.
 Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason.
16. _____ can have a bad effect on health.
A. Hot and wet weather
B. Perfect weather
C. Weather changes
D. High intelligence
17. Intelligence may increase during _____.
A. a perfect weather
B. a storm
C. very hot weather
D. low air
18. Low air pressure _____.
A. increases forgetfulness
B. depresses fat people
C. makes people feel happy
D. causes heart trouble
19. In “perfect weather” of 64°F,_______.
A. people are forgetful
B. people do their work badly
C. thin people feel cold
D. people are in better health
20. The writer wants to tell us that________.
A. hot and cold weather influences all people in the same way
B. weather influences people's lives
C. there is a perfect kind of weather for people's work and health
D. IQ never changes during weather changes

BERLIN－Germany will admit up to 20, 000 foreign high-tech workers, under a plan announced on May 31. Chancellor(总理) Gerhard Schroeder sees this as a way to keep the country from falling behind in information technology.The plan for these so-called “green cards,” not unlike the US work permit system, came in answer to industry complaints that there were not enough qualified workers to fill positions.
Workers who come to Germany under the new rules, effective from August, will be given a five-year work permit after they have completed studies in a related field, or can promise to make at least 100,000 marks (US$ 48,000) in yearly salary.Family members are also allowed to receive work permits. “There is strong competition in the rest of the world for these people,” Schroeder said, mentioning not only the United States but also Britain and France. “Germany would be making a mistake if it didn’t take part in this competition.”
He said employers have already offered 11, 000 jobs through a “green card hotline and some 4, 700 applicants (people who ask for a position) have e-mailed information requests.The Chancellor also said that the number of workers and the time limit of their stay may be extended, which is impossible under current German law. Allowing the workers to stay longer means they could finally become German citizens. Since the beginning of the year, foreigners who have lived in the country for eight years can ask to be naturalized (使加入……国籍).
