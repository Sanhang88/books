二、重点、难点剖析
A．词汇
1．Loaf(n.)--（烤成一定形状的）（大）面包
①Two brown loaves and one large white one, please.
请拿两个黑面包和一个大的白面包。
②Half a loaf is better than no bread.(Saying)
半块面包也比没有面包好。（即"有比没有好"）（谚语）
[说明] loaf是可数名词，bread是不可数名词。因此，"一块面包"要用a loaf of bread来表示，"两块、三块面包"则为two loaves/three loaves of bread，以此类推。
2．fork(n.)--（餐桌上用的）叉，餐叉；（将干草拢上去的）耙子，草叉；（道路、河流的）分岔处，岔口
 ①Westerners eat with a knife and fork.
西方人使用刀叉吃东西
②The soil should be turned over with a fork.
应当用耙子把土翻过来
③We came to a fork in the road, and we couldn't decide whether to take the left fork or the right.
我们来到一个岔路口,不知道是走左边的岔道还是走右边的岔道。

③The government is trying to improve the living conditions of the people.

④One of the conditions of the job is that you should be albe to drive.
做这项工作其中一个条件是你必需会开车。
[说明] condition作"状况，状态"解时，多作不可数名词，可加不定冠词，如例①；当condition意为"情况、环境、条件"时，为可数名词，常用复数形式，如③、④。又如：weather conditions天气条件，working conditions工作条件，necessary conditions必要的条件，等等。
4．grain  *  flour  *   steel
①Corn is America's most important grain.
玉米是美国最重要的粮食。
②Flour is used for making bread, cakes, etc.
面粉可用来做面包、蛋糕等。
③Most tools are made of steel.
大部分工具是钢制的。
[说明] 1）以上三个名词均为不可数名词，grain意为"谷物，粮食"；flour指"面粉"或"谷物磨成的粉"，我们平日所说的"面粉"主要指"小麦的面粉"；steel指"钢"。
2）当grain指"一粒（粮食）"或"谷粒"时是可数名词。
④We mustn't waste a grain of rice. You should eat up every grain of rice in your bowl.我们不应该浪费一粒米。你必须把碗里的每粒饭都吃光。
5．develop(v.)-(使)发展，(使)成长，(使)发育，(使)发达

【说明】1)develop既可作不及物动词,如例①、②，又可作及物动词，如例③、④。
2)develop的现在分词developing 和过去分词developed 可修饰名词作定语，注意其不同的词意：
a developing country 一个发展中的国家

请先复习课文中的句子：While people in other countries in the world were trying to catch wild animals and birds and were still collecting the seeds and nuts, farmers in China were developing the science of farming.当世界上其他国家的人民还在捕猎飞禽走兽、采摘种子果实为生时，中国的农民就已经在发展农业科学了。
在该句的主句和从句中的谓语动词都使用了过去进行时，强调同时进行的动作。例如：
①While I was doing my lessons, my father was reading newspapers.
我在做功课时，我父亲在看报。

他们高呼口号，通过广场。
4．spend(time/money)on sth. 在……方面花费时间/金钱
①She almost spent half of her money on books.
她几乎把一半的钱都用来买书了。
②He spent all his energy on that project.
他将全部精力放在那项工程上了。
<注>spend的主语必须是"人"，宾语可以是"时间、金钱、精力"等。
5．advise sb. to do sth. 建议/劝告某人干某事
①The doctor advised me to have exercise every day.
医生建议我每天锻炼。
②I advised my wife not to spend so much money on clothes.
我劝妻子不要在衣着上花那么多的钱。
[辨析]动词suggest作"建议"解释时不能接不定式作宾语补足语，而是suggest＋n./＋doing sth./＋that从句
③He suggested  a visit to the museum.
visiting the museum.
that we(should)visit the museum.
他建议去参观博物馆。
<注>（1）在that引导的从句中，谓语动词用should＋v.原形或省去should只用v.原形。又如：
