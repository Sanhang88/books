III、完形填空（1×20=20分）
  People do not analyse（分析) every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution（解答) from the last time they had a __31  problem. They often accept the opinion or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without  32  ; they try to find a solution by trial and error.  33  , when all of these methods  34  , the person with a problem has to start analysing. There are six  35  in analysing a problem.
  First the person must recognise that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot ride it to class as he usually does. Sam must  36  that there is a problem with his bicycle.
  Next the person must  37  the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must know why it does not work. For example, he must  38  the parts that are wrong.
  Now the person must look for  39  what will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For example, suppose Sam  40  that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the brakes.  41  , he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about brakes, talk to his friends at the bike shop, or look at his brakes carefully.
  After  42  the problem, the person should have  43  suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an example  44  , his suggestions might be: tighten or loosen the brakes; buy new brakes and change the old one.
  In the end, one  45  seems to be the solution  46  the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes quite  47  because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a  48  way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees there is a piece of chewing gum（口香糖）stuck to a brake. He  49  hits on the solution to his problem: he must clean the brake.
  Finally the solution is  50  . Sam does it and finds his bicycle works perfectly. In short he has solved the problem.
31.A.serious  B.usual   C.similar  D.common
32.A.practice  B.thinking  C.understanding  D.help
33.A.Besides  B.Instead   C.Otherwise   D.However
34.A.fail  B.work   C.change  D.develop
35.A.ways  B.conditions  C.stages   D.orders
36.A.explain  B.prove   C.show   D.see
37.A.judge  B.find  C.describe  D.face
38.A.check  B.determine  C.correct  D.recover
39.A.answers  B.skills   C.explanation   D.information
40.A.hopes  B.argues  C.decides  D.suggests

  What is blood? It is the red liquid which comes out of your finger when you cut it. There are about thirteen pints（品脱）of blood in a man's body. He can give a pint of blood at a time to a blood bank for the use of other men who may need it. A healthy body makes up the pint of blood quickly.
  What does our blood do for us? It takes food to all parts of our bodies and takes waste away from them. All the parts of our bodies are made up of cells（细胞). These cells, which are very small, all need food all the time.
  The blood is like a stream. The cells take what they need out of the blood stream, as plants and fishes take their food out of water. The blood stream carries food and the oxygen which it has taken up in our lungs to all the cells in the body.
  What makes the blood go on moving round the body in a stream? The heart sends it round. A man's heart is about the size of his fist. The heart is a pump（打气筒). It has rooms in it with doors between them. It pumps blood in and out through these doors by changing the size of the rooms so that the doors open and shut.
  The heart keeps the stream of blood going all round the body and back again to itself. Everywhere the blood stream does two things, supplies the cells with food and oxygen and takes away waste. It is as if the blood kept the little fires in the cells burning and took away the ashes.

A.red liquid which comes from your finger
B.red liquid which we can see

  When I was a boy, I belonged to the Boy Scouts（童子军), so I used to go camping every summer, and once something happened which I have never been able to explain.
  We were camping in a place above a river. After arriving, we all rushed down to the river and had a swim. Standing by the river, we noticed that it was surrounded（环绕）by cliffs（悬崖）.
  If someone wanted to reach the river at this point, he had to walk past our camp.
  Several days later, the scoutmaster had to be away for a day. That afternoon, we had supper early. We were sitting round the fire, eating and talking, when a man walked past and went down towards the river. We all felt that this man looked very strange, but, because each of us was afraid of looking very stupid, no one said anything.
  We ate rather slowly, taking as long as possible. After finishing, we collected our plates together so that we could take them to the river where we always washed them. but no one moved towards the river-we stood looking at each other ashamed. Then all shouting at once, we began talking about the man who had walked past us. We agreed how strange he looked and we wondered what he could be doing by the river. We knew that he could only return by passing through our camp.
  An hour passed. Then one of the boys suggested we should creep（悄悄移动) down by the river so that we could see what the man was doing. Moving very slowly and keeping in the shadow, we crept down towards the bank. One boy climbed a tree so that he could see everything clearly. He called to us that there was no one there, so we ran down to the bank, looking everywhere carefully. We could not understand where the man had gone.
  When it got dark, we went back to our camp feeling bewildered. We told the scoutmaster what had happened in the evening. Smiling, he doubted whether we had seen the man, but finally suggested we go and look again. We did, but there was no one there.
  Many years have passed, but I still remember it as if it were yesterday. What did we see? I do not know.

  You are what you eat. This saying has provided scientists with clues（线索）about the diet of hominids-our early relatives of 3 million years ago.
  Studying carbon atoms（碳原子）locked up in tooth enamel（珐琅质), two researchers argue against the widely held belief that hominids ate little more than fruits and leaves. Sponheimer and Julia Lee-Thorp of the University of Cape Town, South Africa, report their findings in Friday's Science.
  There aren't many clues for us to know the life of early hominids. The shape of hominids' teeth offered the first clues. Large and flat-edged with thick enamel, they looked perfect for eating nuts and fruits, different from the sharp teeth one would want to tear into meat with. The first stone tools, which would help in eating meat, didn't appear until about half a million years later.
  Scientists have also found marks on hominids' teeth with patterns very similar to those on the teeth of modern-day fruit eaters. Sponheimer and Lee-Thorp tried a new method, looking at the chemical composition of the tooth enamel. They studied the enamel for the carbon-13. Animals that eat grasses have higher carbon-13 levels than those eating fruits and other plants.
  What they found was that the teeth of the hominids had an in-between amount of carbon-13, which meant not only they were eating fruits, they were eating a lot of grasses, or animals eating grasses. The lower carbon-13 levels could also come from eating certain types of insects（昆虫）.
  But there are people who understand differently. Prof. Ungar of the University of Arkansas agrees the study offers new suggestions of hominid diet, but disagrees about the suggestion that meat could explain the lower carbon-13 levels.
  One suggestion might be true though - take good care of your teeth. In 3 million years, a scientist might be using them to figure out what you ate for dinner.
66.Which of the following can be the best title for the text?
A.Protect Your Teeth
B.What the Hominid Ate
C.Where the Hominid lived
D.The Formation of Tooth Enamel
67.Before the two scientists' findings, most people thought that hominids ________.
A.lived half a million years ago
B.ate mainly fruits and leaves
C.used tools to dig grass
D.had sharp teeth
68.The two scientists' findings were mainly based on the study about ________.
A.the shape of hominids' teeth
B.the teeth marks of early fruit eaters
C.the grasses of 3 million years ago
D.the make-up of the tooth enamel
69.The underlined word "composition" here means _________.
A.a short piece of writing
B.marks made by the stone tools
C.something consisting of a mixture of various substances
D.chemicals produced by the tooth enamel
70.What is it that Prof. Ungar finds doubtful?
A.Hominids possibly ate grass-eating animals.
B.Hominids probably had different diets.
C.Hominids were basically fruit-and grass-eaters.
D.Hominids had lower level of carbon-13 in their teeth.
