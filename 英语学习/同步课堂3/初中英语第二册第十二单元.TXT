【学习方法和难点】
1.Yes, but it'll be watmer later on. 是, 不过一会儿会变得暖和些.
The radio says the snow will stop later on in the day.收音机广播说白天晚些时候雪将停止.
later意为 "稍晚一些",  later on是固定词组,   意为 "at a later time", 表示 "以后"的意思
The rain will stop later on.一会儿雨会停的.
The sun will come out later.过一会儿太阳就会出来.
It'll get watmer later today.今天晚些时候天会转暖.
It'll be sunny later tomorrow.明天后半天天气晴朗.
The child will go to school later next year.明年下半年孩子要上学了.
2. Yeah, and it'll get colder, I'm afraid!   是, 不过恐怕还会更冷的.
I'm afraid 在此是表示说话人的猜测, 与 I think 等意义相似. 可放在句末, 表示语气; 也可放在句首, 如: Yes, and I'm afraid it'll get colder.
3. Is it in the west of China?   它是在中国的西部吗? 注意此句中介词 "in" 的用法, 如某地在另一地的范围内, 表示方位关系用介词 "in"; 如某地不在另一地的范围内, 描述两地的方位关系可用介词 "in". 例如:
Guangdong is in the south of China.广东位于中国的南部.
Guangdong lies to the south of Hunan.广东位于湖南的南部.
There will be a strong wind to the north of the Huai River. 淮河以北将有大风.
4. Bruce rings up his father in Sydney.   布鲁斯给在悉尼的父亲打电话.
ring up打电话, 是英国用法, 等于美国英语 call up,   ring somebody up = call somebody up
He isn't in just now. Will you please ring / call up again? 他现在不在这里,你再来电话好吗?
口语中常常省去up
5. Most of North and South China will have a cold wet day.   中国北方和南方的大部分地区将有
一个又冷由潮湿的天气.
如果强调某一特定的地理位置, 方位词要用大写, 此时的用法带有专有名词的特点.
如: North China, South China; 如只是表明某地单纯的地理位置, 方位词用小写. 如: to the north of the Huai River
6. The temperature will stay above zero in the day-time, but at night it will fall below zero again.
白天气温在零度以上, 夜间又将降到零度以下.
above 和 below 是意思相反的一对介词, 与 over, under意思相近.  above 和 over  都可表示higher than 的意思 (在……之上, 但未接触). 例如
The sky is over / above our heads.
但over 可表示＂在．．．．．．上面＂　（部分或全部覆盖）．如tie a piece of paper over the top of the bottle （在瓶口上扎上一张纸．）　这里不可以用  above 代替over．
below和 under 表示lower than　时，　有时可以互用，　有时则不行．　
例如：
His overcoat reaches just below his knees.他的大衣刚到膝盖下面．
The temperature was ten degrees below zero.气温是零度以下．
There is nothing below / under one yuan in this shop.这家商店里没有低于一元钱的东西．
She looks much below / under sixty.她看上去比６０岁小多了．
in the day-time 在白天． day-time 也可写作daytime
7. 谈论天气
英国人见面聊天时有谈论天气的习惯, 下面是谈论天气的一些用语.
1.What's the weather like today?今天天气怎么样?
= How's the weather today?
It's sunny / windy / rainy / cloudy / snowy today.今天是个晴天/大风天/雨天/阴天/雪天.
2. It's lovely weather, isn't it?今天天气不错, 是不是?
3. It rained heavily all day yesterday.  昨天下了一整天雨.
4. Be quick. It's going to rain.快点儿, 天要下雨了.
5. It looks like rain.今天下午将要下大雨.
6. What good / fine weather it is!
= How fine / good the weather is!天气多好啊!
8. What 和How 引导的感叹句
感叹句一般用来表示说话人的强烈感情. 常用的有What 和How引导的感叹句.
How引导的感叹句其中心词是形容词或副词. How要放在被修饰的形容词或副词之前.
如:
How delicious the mooncakes are!这些月饼多好吃啊!
How hard the students are working!学生们学得多用功啊!
How friendly they all are!他们都是那么友好!
How well Mr. Li teaches!李先生教得多好啊!
What引导的感叹句其中心词是名词. 该名词除用What修饰以外, 前面常常有形容词修饰.句中的主语(通常为代词), 谓语动词(通常为连系动词be), 这时, 主语和谓语一般可以省去.
如:
What a good book (it is)!这是一本多好的书啊!
What a tall building (it is)!一座多么高的大楼啊!
What good children they all are!多么好的孩子们啊!
What nice and clean air!多么清新的空气啊!
