动词
    掌握了动词，你学起英语来就会感到驾轻就熟了。告诉你，一定要记牢动词的现在分词，过去式，过去分词，如果在这些小地方丢分，那才讨厌呢。比如：catch 的过去式和过去分词(caught，caught)你可能就不知道吧?痛下决心，好好记一记吧。下面呢，我们就各个击破。先讲系动词。
    系动词：大概是最简单的动词了。你只需注意的是系动词除了be的形式之外，还有必须和作表语的词语(如形容词, 名词等) 连用, 所以用的时候，可要小心为是呀！如：It smells delicious.(它闻起来味道很美)。delicious 是形容词，不是副词。
    情态动词：首先要记住情态动词后必跟动词原形。must和need几乎是每年的必考题，这里我们重点讲一下。 must的意思是"应当，必须"，侧重于说话者的主观看法，没有时态变化，其否定式是 mustn't，在"Must I(we) ...."的疑问句中，须注意的是其否定回答常用needn't。如：Must I go?(我一定要走吗?)　No,you needn't.(不，不必。) need意为"需要"。既可作实义动词，又可作情态动词，因此在用法上需要注意。作实义动词时，need后跟名词，动名词，或不定式。如：I need to go. (我得走了。)作情态动词时，后跟动词原形。如：You needn't come tomorrow if you are busy. (如果你忙，明天就不必来了。)
    实意动词： 实意动词可谓家族兴旺，人员众多。我们跑(run)，我们跳(jump)，我们笑(laugh)，这些都得用实意动词来表达。我们一起来看一看一些特殊的词吧。它们在接动名词和不定式时意义有所不同。
　  stop：这个词让好多同学大伤了一番脑筋，到底什么时候加to do，什么时候加doing 呢?两者意义又有什么不同呢?OK, Come with me. 看下面两个句子。
    When the teacher came in, they stopped to read.
    When the teacher came in, they stopped talking.
    第一句的意思是"当老师进来时，他们停下来开始读书"。而第二句的意思是"老师进来时，他们停止了说话"。所以stop to do sth表示"停止正在做的事情去干另一件事"。而stop doing表示"中断正在做的某事"。现在明白了吗?
 　 forget，remember，regret 这三个词用法基本相同，只要记住+doing 表示"事情已经做过"，+to do表示"事情还未做"就可以了。forget to do 忘记要去做某事。(未做)　forget doing 忘记做过某事。(已做)
    如：The light is still on. He forgot to turn it off.灯还在亮着，他忘记关了。 ( 没有做关灯的动作)
    He forgot turning the light off.他忘记他已经关了灯了。( 已做过关灯的动作)
    感官动词：see,watch, notice,look at,hear,listen to,smell,taste,feel等 +do 表示动作的完整性，真实性 +doing 表示动作的连续性，进行性。
    如：I saw him work in the garden yesterday. 昨天我看见他在花园里干活了。(强调"我看见了"这个事实)
    I saw him working in the garden yesterday.（强调"我见他正干活"这个动作）昨天我见他正在花园里干活。
