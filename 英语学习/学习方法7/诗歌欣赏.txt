诗歌欣赏

dream

   赏析：每个人都会做梦，但小作者笔下的梦境却将我们带入了一个奇妙的世界。在那里，“我”振翅高飞，尽情翱翔，这一切使人由这里的梦“乡”自然而然地联想到孩提时代那执着，纯真的梦“想”，怀念童年那天真，无忧的时光。

Upon a dream I sleep at night
With two pillows by my side
Into new worlds
I always fly
Under sea，over sky
Speeding，soaring，gaining height
Over mountains，faster flight
Into the great outdoors
I soar
Faster than any one before
No problems，sickness any thing
That the world may ever bring
To be away
From all dismay
Into the world of dreams．

梦　
麦根・舒曼（13岁，美国马里兰州）
深夜沉睡入梦乡
两只枕头伴身旁
踏入美妙新世界
我总在飞翔
畅游海底，掠过苍穹
而又高至巅峰
更快飞翔越群山
飞进野外大自然
我在飞翔
快过以往任何人
无忧无虑无烦恼
疾病痛苦不见了
告别所有忧伤
飞进梦的旅乡


A Mother's Day Thought

   1913年，美国国会通过了一份议案，将每年5月的第二个星期天作为法定的母亲节。母亲节从此流传开来！这一天，许多人通过各种方式来表达对母亲的爱。子女们都要挑选适当的贺卡和礼物送给母亲。其中鲜花、糖果和漂亮的有女性特色的礼物是最受欢迎的。这一天母亲们还会受到特别的款待――在床上享用早餐。请倾听这首献给母亲的歌：

Today is Mother’s Day
To honor you in a special way.
I thank you for all your love...
For all that you do and say.

I thank you for the warm hugs.
For cleaning my wounded knees.
I love you for always being there.
For being so easy to love & please.

I thank you for the many years
you worked to keep me fed.
I think about the unnecessary tears
that I caused you to shed.

I thank you for being a great chef（厨师）.
Oh those pies you made for me.
I thank you for being the chauffeur（司机）
that took me places I wanted to be.

Oh those times you fixed my jeans
when I tore them on the playground.
It was so wonderful just to know...
Momma was always around.

Oh, Momma, look how time has passed us by.
I now have children of my own.
It’s just that today is YOUR day for me.
It doesn't change just because I'm grown!
