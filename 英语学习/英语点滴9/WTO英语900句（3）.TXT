水渍险范围广一些，除了平安险的范围外，还包括自然灾害引起的部分损失。
And All Risks?
那么一切险呢？
All Risks means WPA plus additional risks, or extraneous risks, risks not incidental to transport by sea.

The three basic risks are Free from Particular Average (F.P.A.), With Particular Averaged (W.P.A.) and All Risks (A.R.).
这三种基本险是平安险、水渍险和一切险。
What do they mean respectively?
它们分别是什么意思？

总公司说我们最多只能接受60天信用证。
60 days? Thats all right.
60天？好吧。
But we wish to point out that it is only with a view to encouraging future deals with you that we are accommodating you this time.

As this is the first deal between us, I hope we can trade on customary terms, i.e.,letter of credit payable against sight draft.

You don’t mean to say you want cash, do you?
您不是在说您想要现金吧？
Actually, that’s just what I wanted to say.
实际上，这正是我想要说的。
Don’t you think a letter of credit is just as good as cash? And you can discount it at any time, if you like.
您不认为信用证跟现金差不多吗？ 而且如果您愿意，什么时候都是可以贴现的。
The problem, you see, is that we are now at the turn of the century. We’re worried about the millennium bug. To be on the safe side, I think cash is the only thing we can accept.

Will you still ask for cash in the future, I mean, after we enter the new century?

Then when is the earliest shipment we can expect?

我是说纸箱容易破裂。
There's no need to worry. We can reinforce the cartons with straps.
这个不用担心。我们可以用条带加固。
Look, these goods will have to go a long way before they arrive at our port. What if dampness gets into the package?
但这些货物必须经过长途运输才能抵达我港。包装受潮怎么办？
All the cartons are lined with plastic sheets, so they're absolutely water-proof, I can assure you.
所有纸箱都内衬塑料袋，我可以保证绝对防水。
Most of them do. But the background color should be a little lighter.

Sure. We usually pack our skirts individually in polythene bags, ten dozen to one carton.
好的。我们的衬衣通常每件单独装一塑料袋，10打装一纸箱。
Acceptable. But please pay attention to the design of the inner packing. All the packages must be ready for window display.
好。但请注意内包装的设计，所有的包装都必须适于橱窗展示。
Oh, I’m afraid the price you give is too low. The best I can do is 2%.
哇，恐怕你给的价格太低了。我顶多降价2%。
You say 2% and I say 4%. How about splitting the difference and meeting each other half way? Let’s settle at 3%.
你说2%，我说4%，我们来折中一下，双方各让一半怎样？就降3%吧。
No. I’m afraid it’s still not acceptable.
不行，恐怕我还是不能接受。
What do you say to 2.5%, then?
2.5%怎么样？
Hmm…I appreciate your efforts and sincerity in this transaction. As a token of our cooperation, we accept your bid.
噢……我非常感谢您在这笔生意中所做的努力和诚意。为表示我们愿意合作，我们接受您的递价。

好吧，鉴于我们过去多年的友好合作，我们可以做些考虑，但尽限这批订货。
Then how much can you go down?
那么你能减多少？
1% off the original price.
原价的1%。
1%! Your reduction is too modest. What about 4%?
1%! 你的降价幅度太小了。4%怎么样？
Other companies are also saying that their products are the best.
别的公司也都说他们的产品是最好的。
Let’s meet each other half way. I’ll cut another 5%. That’s definitely my rock bottom price.
我们来折中一下吧。我再降5%。这绝对是最低价格了。
All right. That’s settled.
好吧。就这么定了。
Unfortunately your price appears to be higher than ever.
很遗憾，您的价格比以往都高。
Yes, we know. Because of the price hike in raw materials, we were forced to adjust our prices accordingly.
是的，我们知道。但由于原材料涨价，我们不得不相应调整产品的价格。
Then what’s your idea of a good price?
那你觉得什么价格合适？
I would say 20% off the listed price.
标价减20%。
Impossible. We won’t make any profit at that price. 10% is the best we can do.
那不可能。这样我们就无钱可赚了。最多降10%。
It’s still too high.
还是太高。
Our quality is far beyond comparison. Besides, the market is advancing. Our goods can always find a good sale.
我们的质量是无与伦比的。而且行情上涨，我们的货物销路一直很好。
We are surprised to find that your price is 25% higher compared with other companies.
发现你们的价格比其他公司的高25%，我们很吃惊。
25%？ You can’t be serious!
25%? 你不是开玩笑吧！
That has been confirmed by our survey. I’m afraid I’ll have to cancel the deal unless you reduce your price.
我们调查证实过了。恐怕我将不得不取消这笔生意，除非您降价。
But you know fully well that our product is of superior quality. Other products can’t be compared with it.
但您很了解我们的产品质量上乘，其他产品无法与之相比。
True. But it’s also a fact that your price is too high.
是的。但您的价格太高了，这也是一个事实。
But even for such products we have minimum quality requirements that must be met.
即使是这些产品，我们也规定了必须达到的最低质量要求。
Indeed, they are not bad, indeed. Do you do them in any other colours?

即使要求很高的市场对不同种类的商品，也需要有各种档次的货色和价格。
And durable as well.
而且也耐穿。
Oh, durability is not too important nowadays, especially for women’s shoes, it’s a style conscious market.
噢，耐穿在当今时代已经不大重要了，尤其是女鞋，讲究式样翻新。
Yes, we’ve noticed that.
是的，我们已经注意到了。
Some of your shoes are satisfactory to your domestic market, but they would need to be adapted for the export market or they wouldn’t be acceptable.
你们的一些鞋，对你们国内市场来说是不错的，但是作为外销，就要有些改动，要不然，国外不会接受的。
We can produce shoes modeled after the fashions of different markets or according to buyers’ samples.
我们能按不同市场的流行款式或客户来样，制作不同款式的鞋子。
Your L/C must be opened at least one month before the time of shipment, otherwise we wouldn't be able to catch the ship.
你方信用证必须在装货前一个月开出，否则我们将赶不上船。

没问题。我一回去，就马上安排开立有关信用证。
Fine. I'm very glad our negotiations have arrived at a successful conclusion.
好，我很高兴我们的谈判取得了成功。
