问路 Asking for Directions

Dale : Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the Palace Museum?

Nancy: You can take Bus 5. The driver will tell you where to get off.

Dale : Yes, but I'm driving my own car.

Nancy: Oh,then you drive along this street,turn right at the third crossroad, then take the
first left. Keep straight on until you see a road sign that says "Palace Museum", and then you follow the sign. It will direct you to the Palace Museum.

Dale : Drive along this street, turn right, turn left, keep
straight, and then I'll see the road sign?

Nancy: That's right

Dale : Are you sure that I wont bump into any one-way streets?

Nancy: Well, ...I don't think you will.... I don't see any car around here. Where is your car?

Dale : I parked it over there. You see?

Nancy: Oh, no. Youd better move it before a policeman sees you parking there.

Dale : Why? I don't see any "No Parking" signs.

Nancy: But youre parking in a bus zone.

Dale : Here comes a policeman. I'd better run....Thank you,
miss....Oh, by the way, how long will it take for me to get to the museum?

Nancy: About half an hour.

Dale : Thanks again. You've been very helpful.

Nancy: Hurry up, or you'll get a ticket.
