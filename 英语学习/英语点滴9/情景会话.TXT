Mrs.Fu: Hurry up! We don't have much time left.
Mr.Fu: Take it easy. We still have two hours.
Mrs.Fu: Come on! This is my first time ever to take a plane. I don't want anything to go wrong.
Mr. Fu : Let me take care of everything, all right? Now, let's go to the check-in counter.

Mr. Fu: Here they are.
Airline Clerk : Would you put all your baggage on the scale, please?....Ah, thirty-eight kilos.
Mrs. Fu : Is that inside the free allowance?
Airline Clerk : Yes, we allow twenty kilos each.
Mrs. Fu : That's lucky! (To her husband) What's next?
Mr. Fu : They'll have to check our baggage. Why don't you wait for me upstairs at the refreshment lounge?
Mrs. Fu : All right. (She goes off.)
Airline clerk : Open your baggage, please.
Mr. Fu : Sure. (He opens the bags. The airline clerk examines them.)
Airline Clerk : All right. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Fu : (Upstairs at the lounge.) What did you order for me?

Nancy: Oh,then you drive along this street,turn right at the third crossroad, then take the
first left. Keep straight on until you see a road sign that says "Palace Museum", and then you follow the sign. It will direct you to the Palace Museum.
Dale : Drive along this street, turn right, turn left, keep
straight, and then I'll see the road sign?
Nancy: That's right
Dale : Are you sure that I wont bump into any one-way streets?
Nancy: Well, ...I don't think you will.... I don't see any car around here. Where is your car?
Dale : I parked it over there. You see?
Nancy: Oh, no. Youd better move it before a policeman sees you parking there.
Dale : Why? I don't see any "No Parking" signs.
Nancy: But youre parking in a bus zone.
Dale : Here comes a policeman. I'd better run....Thank you,

   A difficult or abusive boss can poison the best of jobs. But you are not powerless; before you even consider quitting, try the boss-taming strategies below.
   Ò»¸öÄÑ²ø»òÏ²»¶ÀÄÓÃÈ¨Á¦µÄÀÏ°å¿ÉÄÜ»á½«ºÃ¶Ë¶ËµÄ¹¤×÷¸ãÔÒ¡£µ«Äã²¢²»ÊÇÍêÈ«ÎŞÄÜÎªÁ¦µÄ£»ÔÚÄã¿¼ÂÇ²»¸ÉÖ®Ç°£¬²»·ÁÊÔÒ»ÊÔÏÂÃæ¼¸ÖÖ¶Ô¸¶ÀÏ°åµÄ²ßÂÔ£º
   CHANGE YOUR OWN WAY Few  people are randomly violent. They blow up on particular occasions over particular issues. Track your boss's peeves and patterns, then eliminate the triggers within your control. For example, if he snarls when you arrive just five minutes late to work or make one typo on a memo, avoid these slipups no matter how trivial they seem. If one of your coworkers manages your boss's moods skillfully, ask him what you could be doing more effectively, then borrow a few of his moves.

   STAY COOL UNDER FIRE Respond to the content of your boss's tirade, not the curses. Whatever you do, don't cower, stammer or apologize. Some people get off on brutalizing others, and passivity makes you a target. Respond confidently: Say "I'd like to put together a report that will satisfy you. Let's discuss how I can make that happen.

   USE CONSTRUCTIVE CONFRONTATION Your boss may be more willing to change his behavior than you think. Some managers don't realize how much their words or actions upset staffers. Tell him how his outbursts make you feel. Say for example, When you call me names and criticize my work in meetings I feel demoralized Please address me respectfully and take me aside to discuss criticisms in private. If he values your work, he may rein in his abusiveness.

   APPEAL TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY If your boss becomes intolerably abusive, you may have to go above his head to your personnel department or senior manager. But before you take this course, discreetly, ask coworkers if they've clashed with your boss in the past. Ideally, they will back you up and permit you to mention their names when you make your charges. That way, you can bring a pattern of behavior to management's attention. Begin by asking, ¡°Can I have a discussion with you off the record?" Then cite examples that show how your boss's treatment negatively affects your performance. Make it clear that you want to improve the situation, not punish your boss. If discipline is what he needs, let the higher-ups make that call.

I can't miss the ten o'clock train. I'm going to Beijing on business.
I'm sure it's with the boss again this time.
Nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss.
They scheduled the negotiation at nine tomorrow morning.
There're still several things that haven't been decided yet before the trip.
Don't you think it a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days?
The train isn't crowded at all recently.
Last time, I went on a business trip with the boss ,I didn't even have enough to eat.
The first thing you'll do is look for a comfortable hotel.
You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip.
Quite often we have to play host to them though it's their home ground.
Nothing's been decided yet. Why going there in such a hurry?
The company is sometimes very cheap on the travel expenses.
I like to take an accasional business trip for a change.
On this trip I have to visit several important customers.
We always discuss business matters. It's boring.
Every time I'm back, I have to write a detailed report of the business trip.
Sometimes you arrive there around two or three o'clock in the morning.
Business trip is tiring to me.
She always gets some presents for other people in the office when she's back from a business trip.]

   The telephone system in the United States, as in many other countries, has a special number for each region of the country. It is called an "area code". If you know the area code and the phone number, it's usually cheaper to dial the number yourself. Of course, you must go through [Í¨¹ı] an operator to make person-to-person or collect calls. You can dial direct to many countries overseas or you can ask for the overseas operator.
