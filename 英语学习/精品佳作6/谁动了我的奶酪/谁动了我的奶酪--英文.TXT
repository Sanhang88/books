英文名篇-谁动了我的奶酪

   ONCE, long ago in a land far away, there lived four little characters who ran through a maze looking for cheese to nourish them and make them happy.
   Two were mice, named "Sniff" and "Scurry" and two were littlepeople-beings who were as small as mice but who looked and acted a lot like people today.
   Their names were "Hem" and "Haw."
   Due to their small size, it would be easy not to notice what the four of them were doing. But if you looked closely enough, you could discover the most amazing things!
   Every day the mice and the littlepeople spent time in the maze looking for their own special cheese. The mice, Sniff and Scurry, possessing only simple rodent brains, but good instincts, searched for the hard nibbling cheese they liked, as mice often do.
   The two littlepeople, Hem and Haw, used their brains, filled with many beliefs, to search for a very different kind of Cheese - with a capital C -which they believed would make them feel happy and successful.
   As different as the mice and littlepeople were, they shared something in common: every morning, they each put on their jogging suits and running shoes, left their little homes, and raced out into the maze looking for their favorite cheese.
   The maze was a labyrinth of corridors and chambers, some containing delicious cheese. But there were also dark corners and blind alleys leading nowhere. It was an easy place for anyone to get lost.
   However, for those who found their way, the maze held secrets that let them enjoy a better life.
   The mice, Sniff and Scurry, used the simple, but inefficient,trial-and-error method of finding cheese. They ran down one corridor and if it proved empty, they turned and ran down another.
   Sniff would smell out the general direction of the cheese, using his great nose, and Scurry would race ahead. They got lost, as you might expect, went off in the wrong direction and often bumped into walls.
   However, the two littlepeople, Hem and Haw, used a different method that relied on their ability to think and learn from their past experiences,although, they would sometimes get confused by their beliefs and emotions.
   Eventually in their own way, they all discovered what they were looking for - they each found their own kind of cheese one day at the end of one of the corridors in Cheese Station C.
   Every morning after that, the mice and the littlepeople dressed in their running gear and headed over to Cheese Station C. It wasn't long before they each established their own routine.
   Sniff and Scurry continued to wake early every day and race through the maze, always following the same route.
   When they arrived at their destination, the mice took off their running shoes, tied them together and hung them around their necks-so they could get to them quickly whenever they needed them again. Then they enjoyed the cheese.
   In the beginning Hem and Haw also raced toward Cheese Station C every morning to enjoy the tasty new morsels that awaited them.
   But after a while, a different routine set in for the littlepeople.
   Hem and Haw awoke each day a little later, dressed a little slower, and walked to Cheese Station C. After all, they knew where the Cheese was now and how to get there.
   They had no idea where the Cheese came from, or who put it there. They just assumed it would be there.
   As soon as Hem and Haw arrived at Cheese Station C each morning, they settled in and made themselves at home. They hung up their jogging suits, put away their running shoes and put on their slippers. They were becoming very comfortable now that they had found the Cheese.
   "This is great," Hem said. "There's enough Cheese here to last us forever."
   The littlepeople felt happy and successful, and thought they were now secure.
   It wasn't long before Hem and Haw regarded the Cheese they found at Cheese Station C as their cheese. It was such a large store of Cheese that they eventually moved their homes to be closer to it, and built a social life around it.
   To make themselves feel more at home, Hem and Haw decorated the walls with sayings and even drew pictures of Cheese around them which made them smile.
   One read:
   Sometimes Hem and Haw would take their friends by to see their pile of Cheese at Cheese Station C, and point to it with pride, saying, "Pretty nice Cheese, huh?" Sometimes they shared it with their friends and sometimes they didn't.
   "We deserve this Cheese," Hem said. "We certainly had to work long and hard enough to find it." He picked up a nice fresh piece and ate it.
   Afterwards, Hem fell asleep, as he often did.
   Every night the littlepeople would waddle home, full of Cheese, and every morning they would confidently return for more.
   This went on for quite some time.
   After a while Hem's and Haw's confidence grew into arrogance. Soon they became so comfortable they didn't even notice what was happening.
   As time went on, Sniff and Scurry continued their routine. They arrived early each morning and sniffed and scratched and scurried around Cheese Station C, inspecting the area to see if there had been any changes from the day before. Then they would sit down to nibble on the cheese.
   One morning they arrived at Cheese Station C and discovered there was no cheese.
   They weren't surprised. Since Sniff and Scurry had noticed the supply of cheese had been getting smaller every day, they were prepared for the inevitable and knew instinctively what to do.
   They looked at each other, removed the running shoes they had tied together and hung conveniently around their necks, put them on their feet and laced them up.
   The mice did not overanalyze things. And they were not burdened with many complex beliefs.
   To the mice, the problem and the answer were both simple. The situation at Cheese Station C had changed. So, Sniff and Scurry decided to change.
   They both looked out into the maze. Then Sniff lifted his nose, sniffed, and nodded to Scurry, who took off running through the maze, while Sniff followed as fast as he could.
   They were quickly off in search of New Cheese.
   Later that same day, Hem and Haw arrived at Cheese Station C. They had not been paying attention to the small changes that had been taking place each day, so they took it for granted their Cheese would be there.
   They were unprepared for what they found.
   "What! No Cheese?" Hem yelled. He continued yelling, "No Cheese? No Cheese?" as though if he shouted loud enough someone would put it back.

   "What! No Cheese?" Hem yelled. He continued yelling, "No Cheese? No Cheese?" as though if he shouted loud enough someone would put it back.
   "Who moved my Cheese?" he hollered.
   Finally, he put his hands on his hips, his face turned red, and he screamed at the top of his voice, "It's not fair!"
   Haw just shook his head in disbelief. He, too, had counted on finding Cheese at Cheese Station C. He stood there for a long time, frozen with shock. He was just not ready for this.
   Hem was yelling something, but Haw didn't want to hear it. He didn't want to deal with what was facing him, so he just tuned everything out.
   The littlepeoples' behavior was not very attractive or productive but it was understandable.
   Finding Cheese wasn't easy, and it meant a great deal more to the littlepeople than just having enough of it to eat every day.
   Finding Cheese was the littlepeoples' way of getting what they thought they needed to be happy. They had their own ideas of what Cheese meant to them, depending on their taste.
   For some, finding Cheese was having material things. For others it was enjoying good health, or developing a spiritual sense of well-being.
   For Haw, Cheese just meant feeling safe, having a loving family someday and living in a cozy cottage on Cheddar Lane.
   To Hem, Cheese was becoming A Big Cheese in charge of others and owning a big house atop Camembert Hill.
   Because Cheese was important to them, the two littlepeople spent a long time trying to decide what to do. All they could think of was to keep looking around Cheeseless Station C to see if the Cheese was really gone.
   While Sniff and Scurry had quickly moved on, Hem and Haw continued to hem and haw.
   They ranted and raved at the injustice of it all. Haw started to get depressed. What would happen if the Cheese wasn't there tomorrow? He had made future plans based on this Cheese.
   The littlepeople couldn't believe it. How could this have happened? No one had warned them. It wasn't right. It was not the way things were supposed to be.
   Hem and Haw went home that night hungry and discouraged. But before they left, Haw wrote on the wall:
   The next day Hem and Haw left their homes, and returned to Cheese Station C again, where they still expected, somehow, to find their Cheese.
   The situation hadn't changed, the Cheese was no longer there. The littlepeople didn't know what to do. Hem and Haw just stood there, immobilized like two statues.
   Haw shut his eyes as tight as he could and put his hands over his ears. He just wanted to block everything out. He didn't want to know the Cheese supply had gradually been getting smaller. He believed it had been moved all of a sudden.
   Hem analyzed the situation over and over and eventually his complicated brain with its huge belief system took hold. "Why did they do this to me?" he demanded. "What's really going on here?"
   Finally, Haw opened his eyes, looked around and said, "By the way, where are Sniff and Scurry? Do you think they know something we don't?" he hollered.
   Finally, he put his hands on his hips, his face turned red, and he screamed at the top of his voice, "It's not fair!"
