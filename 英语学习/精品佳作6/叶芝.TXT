William Butler Yeats
(1865-1939)

   William Butler Yeats was born in Dublin on June 13, 1865. He was educated in London and Dublin. After completing high school he decided he wanted to be an artist and poet and began attending art school. He left not too long after because he decided to concentrate on his poetry.

   Yeats was interested in many kinds of folklore and mythology, and in his early works he often wrote on pagan and Irish themes. On a visit in Ireland, he met Maud Gonne, and actress and Irish nationalist for whom he suffered an unrequited love. However, she inspired much of his early works and because of her he became interested in the Irish movement for independence. In 1922 he became a Senator of the Irish Free State.

   It is generally considered that as Yeats grew older his poetry become more refined and perfected, and his later works are acknowledged to be his best. In 1923, Yeats won the Nobel Prize. He died in France in 1939 and was buried in Ireland.


诗人致他的爱
　
我用充满敬意的手给你带来
我的无穷无尽的梦的书本，
激情的折磨使得女人苍白，
像潮水磨得沙子灰而微红；
呵，从苍白的时间之火中传来的
号角声，但更古老的是我的心，
因为无穷无尽的梦而苍白的
女人，我向你献上激情的音韵。
A Poet To His Beloved
by William Butler Yeats

I BRING you with reverent hands
The books of my numberless dreams,
White woman that passion has worn
As the tide wears the dove-grey sands,
And with heart more old than the horn
That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:
White woman with numberless dreams,
I bring you my passionate rhyme.
