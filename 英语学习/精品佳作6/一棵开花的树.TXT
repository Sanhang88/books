一棵开花的树
席慕容

如何让你遇见我
在我最美丽的时刻
为这
我已在佛前 求了五百年
求佛让我们结这一段尘缘
佛于是把我变成一棵树
长在你必经的路边
阳光下慎重地开满花朵
朵朵都是我前世的企盼

当你走近　请你细听
那颤抖的叶是我等待的热情
而当你终于无视地走过
在你身后落了一地的
朋友啊　那不是花瓣
是我凋零的心

May Buddha let us meet
in my most beautiful hours,
I have prayed for it
for five hundred years.

Buddha made me a tree
by the path you may take,
In full blossoms I'm waiting in the sun
every flower carrying my previous hope.

As you are near, listen carefully
the quivering leaves are my waiting zeal,
As you pass by the tree
without noticing me,
My friend, upon the ground behind you
is not the fallen petals but my withered heart.

楼兰新娘
席慕容

我的爱人　曾含泪
将我埋葬
用珠玉　用乳香
将我光滑的身躯包裹
再用颤抖的手　将鸟羽
插在我如缎的发上

他轻轻阖上我的双眼
知道　他是我眼中
最后的形象
把鲜花洒满在我胸前
同时洒落的
还有他的爱和忧伤
夕阳西下
楼兰空自繁华
我的爱人孤独地离去
遗我以亘古的黑暗
和　亘古的
甜蜜与悲凄

而我绝不能饶恕你们
这样鲁莽地把我惊醒
曝我于不再相识的
荒凉之上

敲碎我　敲碎我
曾那样温柔的心

只有斜阳仍是
当日的斜阳　可是
有谁　有谁　有谁
能把我重新埋葬
还我千年旧梦
我应仍是　楼兰的新娘
楼兰新娘

A Bride of the Ancient Kingdom, Loulan
By Xi Murong

My lover buried me personally
Shedding his tears silently,
With pearls and jewelry he covered my bare body,
And treated it in spice-immersed way.
Then he put feathers on my brocade-like hairs
By his trembling hands.
He shut my eyes lightly and gently
He knew that he would leave me his last
Look vividly.
He was scattering fresh flowers over my chest,
And simultaneously
With his love and melancholy
The setting sun wheeling on her west way,
Left the Kingdom Loulan prosperous empty.
Alone my lover left me
In endless darkness,
Happiness and sadness.

However absolutely I don’t forgive you
Who woke me up in such a foolhardy way?
Of exposing me on the land I hardly know,
As the waste quietly lay.

You cracked me over and over again
To have my gentle heart broken,

Only the setting sun
Is still the setting sun,
However, any man, any man
Could bury me again
Giving back my 1000-year dream
That still I should be a bride of the Kingdom,
A bride of the Kingdom.
