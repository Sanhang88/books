我仍将奋起

Still I Rise

You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness1 upset you?
Why are you beset2 with gloom?
'Cause3 I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping4 in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness5 offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin'6 in my own backyard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling8 I bear in the tide.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.

你可以把我写进历史
用你那尖刻的、撒谎的文字，
你可以把我踩进泥地
但像尘土，我仍将奋起。

我的精神抖擞可让你烦恼？
为什么你要皱着眉头？
因为我步履矫健
像家有油井用泵抽。

像月亮，像太阳，
浪潮退却亦复涨，
扬得高高像希望，
我仍将奋起。

你可曾想见到我颓丧？
俯首低头，目光低垂？
弯着腰身像落泪，
若不禁风，心在哭泣？

我的铮铮傲骨可让你厌恶？
别难受，别在乎
因为我笑声爽朗
像在自家后院采掘金矿。

你可以用言辞向我射击，
你可以用目光向我砍劈，
你可以用仇恨将我击毙，
但像空气，我仍将奋起。

我的性感迷人可让你烦恼？
我的翩翩舞蹈可让你惊奇？
因为我舞姿飞扬
像我大腿交叉处拥有钻石。

从历史耻辱的茅舍
我奋起
从逝去的苦难岁月
我奋起
我是黑色的海洋，水阔浪高
汹涌澎湃，领舵弄潮。

把恐怖的黑夜抛在身后
我奋起
走向光明灿烂的白昼
我奋起
带着祖先赐予的力量，
我是奴隶的梦想和希望。
我奋起
我奋起
我奋起。
