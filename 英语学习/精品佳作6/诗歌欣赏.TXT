Love's Witness――爱情的见证

Slight unpremeditated Words are borne
By every common Wind into the Air;
Carelessly utter'd, die as soon as born，
And in one instant give both Hope and Fear：
Breathing all Contraries with the same Wind
According to the Caprice of the Mind.

But Billetdoux are constant Witnesses，
Substantial Records to Eternity;
Just Evidences，who the Truth confess,
On which the Lover safely may rely；
They're serious Thoughts，digested and resolv'd；
And last，when Words are into Clouds devolv'd.


不加思索的轻率话语，
被每一次平凡的呼吸载入空气；
随便说说，刚出口即消失，
一瞬间给人希望和恐惧：
同一气息呼出万般矛盾心肠，
追随心灵无常的遐想。

但情书则是恒常的见证，
直至永恒的实体记录；
公道的证物，它道出真诚，
恋人能在其上安心依附；
它们是严肃的思想，经过深思熟虑；
当话语在云外消失，它们还将延续。


Almost Persuaded--- by David Houston

Last night all alone in the bar room

Met a girl with a drink in her hand

She has ruby red eyes, cold black hair

And eyes that could tempt any man

And she came and sat down at my table

And there she placed her soft hand in mine

I found myself wanting to kiss her

For temptation was flowing like wine

And I Almost Persuaded

To strip myself off my pride

Almost Persuaded

To push my conscience aside

And we danced and she whispered,

“I need you”

Take me away from here and be my man

Then I looked into her eyes and I saw ----

The reflection of my wedding band

And I Almost Persuaded

To let strange lips lead me on

Almost Persuaded

But your sweet love made me

Stop and go home

To Love You Well Enough by Robert A. Daniels

Do I know you well enough
To love you well enough
To dream by your side
Until death do we part?

Am I one with you
In the way that the star and its light are one,
Or is there division, as a horizon,
Standing between us?

Do you fill me or empty me;
Do you invade my spirit
Or allow it to be released
Like a genie from a tarnished lamp?

Do I know you well enough
To love you well enough
To dream by your side
Until death do we part?


Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again
--- by Xu Zhimo

再别康桥
徐志摩

Very quietly I take my leave
As quietly as I came here;
Quietly I wave good-bye
To the rosy clouds in the western sky.

The golden willows by the riverside
Are young brides in the setting sun;
Their reflections on the shimmering waves
Always linger in the depth of my heart.

The floatingheart growing in the sludge
Sways leisurely under the water;
In the gentle waves of Cambridge
I would be a water plant!

That pool under the shade of elm trees
Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;
Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds
Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?

To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream
To where the green grass is more verdant;
Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight
And sing aloud in the splendour of starlight.

But I cannot sing aloud
Quietness is my farewell music;
Even summer insects heep silence for me
Silent is Cambridge tonight!

Very quietly I take my leave
As quietly as I came here;
Gently I flick my sleeves
Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away 　


轻轻的我走了，
正如我轻轻的来；
我轻轻的招手， 　
作别西天的云彩。

那河畔的金柳 　
是夕阳中的新娘
波光里的艳影， 　
在我的心头荡漾。

软泥上的青荇，
油油的在水底招摇；
在康河的柔波里，
我甘心做一条水草

那榆荫下的一潭，
不是清泉，是天上虹
揉碎在浮藻间，
沉淀着彩虹似的梦。

寻梦？撑一支长篙，
向青草更青处漫溯，
满载一船星辉，
在星辉斑斓里放歌

但我不能放歌，
悄悄是别离的笙箫；
夏虫也为我沉默，
沉默是今晚的康桥！

悄悄的我走了，
正如我悄悄的来；
我挥一挥衣袖，
不带走一片云彩。 　


To Wang Lun
--- Li Bai

I'm on board; We're about to sail,

When there's stamping and singing on shore;

Peach Blossom Pool is a thousand feet deep,

Yet not so deep,Wang Lun,as your love for me.

赠 汪 伦
--- 李 白

李 白 乘 舟 将 欲 行 ，

忽 闻 岸 上 踏 歌 声 。

桃 花 潭 水 深 千 尺 ，

不 及 汪 伦 送 我 情 。


Thoughts in the Silent Night
--- Li Bai

Beside my bed a pool of light---

Is it hoarfrost on the ground?

I lift my eyes and see the moon,

I bend my head and think of home.

静 夜 思
- 李 白

床 前 明 月 光 ，

疑 是 地 上 霜 。

举 头 望 明 月 ，

低 头 思 故 乡 。


The Deer Enclosure
--- Wang Wei

Empty the hills,no man in sight,

Yet voices echo here;

Deep in the woods slanting sunlight,

Falls on the jade-green moss.

鹿 柴 --- 王 维

空 山 不 见 人 ，

但 闻 人 语 响 。

返 景 入 深 林 ，

复 照 青 苔 上 。 　


In the Rainy Season of Spring
--- Du Mu

It drizeles endlessly during the rainy season in spring,

Travellers along the road look gloomy and miserable.

When I ask a shepherd boy where I can find a tavern,

He points at a distant hamlet nestling amidst apricot blossoms. 　

清 明
--- 杜 牧

清明时节雨纷纷，

路上行人欲断魂。

借问酒家何处有，

牧童遥指杏花村。 　


The Gully of Twittering Birds --- Wang Wei

Idly I watch the cassia petals fall;

Silent the night and empty the spring hills;

The rising moon startles the mountain birds;

Which twitter fitfully in the spring gully. 　

鸟 鸣 涧
--- 王 维

人 闲 桂 花 落，

夜 静 春 山 空。

月 出 惊 山 鸟，

时 鸣 春 涧 中。


The Bamboo Lodge
--- Wang wei

Seated alone by shadowy bamboos,

I strum my lyre and laugh aloud;

None knows that I am here, deep in the woods;

Only the bright moon comes to shine on me. 　

竹 里 馆
--- 王 维

独 坐 幽 篁 里，

弹 琴 复 长 啸。

深 林 人 不 知，

明 月 来 相 照。 　


Auld Lang Syne

Should auld acquanintance be forgot，

And never brought to mind?

Should auld acquaintance be forgot，

And days of auld long syne?

And here's a hand,my trusty frien'

And gie's a hand o' thine;

We'll take a cup o' kindness yet.

For auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne my dear,

For auld lang syne,

We'll take a cup o' kindness yet

For auld lang syne.

友谊地久天长

怎能忘记旧日朋友

心中能不怀念？

旧日朋友怎能相忘，

友谊地久天长。

我们往日情意相投，

让我们紧握手，

让我们举杯痛饮，

友谊地久天长。

友情常在我心，

亲密的朋友

举杯痛饮，

同声歌唱友谊地久天长。

Bed in Summer Robert Louis Stevenson

In winter I get up at night

And dress by yellow candle-light.

In summer, quite the other way,

I have to go to bed by day.

I have to go to bed and see

The birds still hopping on the tree,

Or hear the grown-up people's feet

Still going past me in the street.

And does it seem hard to you,

When all the sky is clear and blue,

And I should like so much to play,

To have to go to bed by day?

夏之眠 　

冬日里我夜里起床，

借着昏黄的烛光穿衣裳。

夏日里可不一样，

我不得不白日里就睡觉上床。

小鸟儿仍在树上蹦蹦跳跳，

大人们的脚步声

还在大街上回响，

我却得早早睡觉上床。

天空还是那么蔚蓝，明亮，

我多么想嬉戏，玩耍，

你是否觉得

这时候就睡觉难入梦乡？


Silent meaning

The word not spoken goes not quite unheard.

It lingers in the eye, in the semi-arch of brow.

A gesture of the hand speaks pages more than words,

The echo rests in the heart as driftwood does in sand,

To be rubbed by time until it rots or shines.

The word not spoken touches us as music does the mind.

沉默的含义

无声的语言
并非完全听不见。
它荡漾在眼波里，
表露在眉宇间。

一个心照不宣的手势
胜过万语千言，
萦绕心灵的回音
好象浮木浪迹于沙滩，

随着岁月的消磨
不是燃烧，就是腐烂。
无声的语言
触及我们的情感，
恰似有声的音乐
拨动人们的心弦


Sliver By Walter de la Mare

Slowly, silently, now the moon

Walks the night in her silver shoon;

This way, and that, she peers, and sees

Sliver fruit upon silver trees;

One by one the casements catch

Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;

Couched in his kennel, like a log,

With paws of silver sleeps the dog;

From their shadowy cote the white breasts peep

Of doves in a silver-feathered sleep;

A harvest mouse goes scampering by,

With silver claws, and silver eye;

And motionless fish in the water gleam,

By silver reeds in a silver stream.

银 白

月 神 着 素 履，

轻 悄 飘 环 宇。

偶 然 窥 果 园，

果 实 白 如 玉。

茅 屋 凝 霜 雪，

窗 棂 银 光 聚。

柴 门 无 犬 吠，

悠 然 美 梦 居。

白 鸽 梦 中 觑，

清 辉 照 银 羽。

玉 鼠 奔 如 电，

银 光 映 眼 眸。

芦 苇 白 似 雪，

鱼 儿 不 潜 游。 　


Morning

I love to wake to each new day,

And brush my dreams

Of night away,

And look out through my window wide

To see what weather is outside,

And wonder what exciting thing

This shining, un-used day

Will bring.

清 晨

我喜欢醒来迎接每一个清晨，

轻松抖落一夜的梦尘，

从窗口向外眺望远处，

广茅的天地是否晴空无云，

想象何等激动人心的事

这灿烂崭新的一天将献呈。 　


Ode To The Sea－－－Pablo Neruda

Here surrounding the island there is sea
But what sea
lt's always overflowing
says " Yes," then“No," then "No"again.
And "No,"says"Yes" in blue,
in sea spray raging,
says "No" and "No" again.
It can't be still.
It stammers "my name is sea."
It slaps the rocks,
and when they aren't convinced
Strokes them and soaks them
and smolders them with kisses.
with seven green tongues of seven green dogs,
Or seven green tigers, or Seven green seas
Beating its chest, stammering its name.
Oh, sea, this is your name.
oh, comrade ocean, don't waste time
or water getting so upset.
Help us instead.
We're meager fishermen,
men from the shore.
We're hungry and cold
and you're our foe.
Don't beat so hard, don't shout so loud.
Open your green coffers.
Place gifts of silver in our hands.
Give us this day our daily fish.

至大海

一片汪洋环绕岛屿。
这是怎样的大海啊?
汹涌不休,
说“是”,接而“不”,一遍叉一遍 重复着“不”,它忧悒地说“是”, 却咆哮着
重复说“不”,
永无静止。
它吞吐道：“我的名字叫大海。” 岩石不相信,
于是海浪拍打着
撞击着,冲剃着。
叉以无数个亲吻去抚慰它们。
以从七只猛犬、七头白虎、七大汪洋 取来的七条利舌
拍打胸膛,吐出它的名字。
噢,大海,我们知道你的名字。
噢,大海同志,别虚度时日
也别空自悲伤。
帮帮我们吧
我们是贫困潦倒的渔民。
你岸上的子民
我们饥寒交迫。
而你是我们的对手。
别那么气势汹汹,别那么大声地咆哮。
打开你珍贵的宝箱吧,
将财富赐于我们
赐于我们今日的收获吧。
