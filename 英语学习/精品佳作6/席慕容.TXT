英译：一棵开花的树　(文：席慕容)
（这首诗大家都该知道吧？）

如何让你遇见我
在我最美丽的时刻
为这
我已在佛前 求了五百年
求佛让我们结这一段尘缘
佛于是把我变成一棵树
长在你必经的路边
阳光下慎重地开满花朵
朵朵都是我前世的企盼

当你走近　请你细听
那颤抖的叶是我等待的热情
而当你终于无视地走过
在你身后落了一地的
朋友啊　那不是花瓣
是我凋零的心


May Buddha let us meet
in my most beautiful hours,
I have prayed for it
for five hundred years.

Buddha made me a tree
by the path you may take,
In full blossoms I“m waiting in the sun
every flower carrying my previous hope.


As you are near, listen carefully
the quivering leaves are my waiting zeal,
As you pass by the tree
without noticing me,
My friend, upon the ground behind you
is not the fallen petals but my withered heart.
