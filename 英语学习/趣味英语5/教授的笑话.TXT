The Professor's Lunch
   An absent-minded professor was lecturing on anatomy.
   "To show you more clearly what I mean. I have here a parcel with a dissected frog. I want you to examine it very carefully."
   The professor unwrapped the parcel and saw that it contained two sandwiches and a hardboiled egg. Astonished, the professor said:" I was sure I had eaten my lunch, but where is the frog?"

教授的午餐
   一位心不在焉的教授正在讲解剖学。“为了让你们更明白我的意思，我这里有一个小包，里面装着一只解剖了的青蛙，我要你们仔细的观察。”
   教授打开小包，看见里边包着两块三明治和一个煮老的鸡蛋。教授惊讶地说：“我肯定是吃过午餐的，可青蛙到哪儿去了？”。

Absent-minded Professor
   There were three professors at the railway station. They were deep in conversation. The train had just arrived, but they did not notice it. Then the guard shouted, "Take your seats, please!"
   The professors heard the guard and rushed for the train. Two of them got on the train before it moved. The third one was left behind. It was Professor Egghead. He looked worried.
   One of the professor's students was at the station. He tried to comfort the professor. "It wasn't really bad, sir," said the student. "Two out of three caught the train. That's quite good, you know." "I know," the professor said. "But it was my train. MY friends only came to say goodbye."

心不在焉的教授
   三位教授在火车站的站台上。他们正在聚精会神地谈话。火车进站了，他们都没有发觉。这时列车员喊道：“请上车了！”
   教授们听到喊声后赶紧向火车跑去，两位教授刚登上火车，火车就开动了。另一位叫埃哈德的教授没能赶上。他看上去很着急。
   教授的一个学生也在车站等车。他尽力安慰教授，他说：“这还不是很糟，三个人有两个人上了火车。您要知道这已经不错了。”教授说：“我知道，可我是来赶火车的，那两位朋友是来为我送行的。”
