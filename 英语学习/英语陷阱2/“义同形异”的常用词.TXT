“义同形异”的常用词

１.Over / above
   "Over"和"above"这两个介词的意思是在……上面。“我们可以说(1)The sky is above our heads,也可以说(2)The sky is over our heads.我们也可以说(3)He spread his handkerchief over his face.但不能说*(4)He spread his handkerchief above his face. 同样的，可以说(5)John has travelled all over the world以及 (6)The King reigns over a great empire，但是(5)和(6)里的 "over"却不可以"above"取代。
２.bring / take
   "Bring"和"take"的意思相同，但用法并不一样。
   "Bring"指东西向说话的人的方向去，如：
   (7) Bring me the book, please.
   "Take"指东西向说话的人离去，如：
   (8)Take the dictionary away from me .
   由此可见，"bring"和"take"都表示东西要移动，只是方向不同："bring"向说话者而来；"take"向说话者而去。
３.Certain / sure
   "Certain"和"sure"都含“确定”之意，只是在句中的用法有些不同。下列第九到十一的句子都对，但第十二的句子就不行了：
   (9) We are certain to come to the party. / Tom is sure to come today.
   (10) I am not certain whether I will be able to do it. / Are you sure that you will do it?
   (11) It is certain that Jason will leave me.
   (12) It is sure that Jason will leave me.
４. rob / Steal
   虽然这两个字都是及物动词，但用法不同，不可互相取代。
   "Steal"的宾语通常是被偷的东西，如“钱，手表”之类。"Rob" 的宾语必须是“人”或“地方”。如：
   (13) A thief entered her house and stole her valuables.
   (14) A stranger robbed a passer-by.
   (15) Who robbed the bank last night?
５.chase / follow
   这两个动词，一个是“追逐”，另一个是“跟随”，都是人家在前，他在后，但用起来不一样；"chase"不但是动词，也是名词，如：
   (16)The cat chased the mouse and caught it soon after.
   (17)The puplis followed the teacher to the classroom.
   (18)There was a thrilling car chase in the film.
   (19) Social unrest follows widespread unemployment.
   (20) I could not follow what he was saying.
