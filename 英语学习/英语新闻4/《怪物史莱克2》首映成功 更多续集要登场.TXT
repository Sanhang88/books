Shrek to spawn more sequels
《怪物史莱克2》首映成功 更多续集要登场

   Two more sequels to the animated film Shrek are to be made after the success of Shrek 2 exceeded expectations.
   Shrek 2, about the adventures of a green ogre, enjoyed the second-biggest US cinema opening ever, taking $108mover its first weekend.
   Dreamworks said the film's success meant the studio would move ahead with plans for a third and fourth.
   Talks are underway with the actors who voice the characters including Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy.
   Ann Daly, the head of Dreamworks animation, said: "It wasn't really advisable to start working on three and four until we knew that we actually had something in two, and certainly this weekend confirmed that we do."
   Ms Daly said Dreamworks was also in final talks with Mike Myers and Diaz who voice Shrek and Princess Fiona.
   They also hope to strike a deal with Murphy as the talking Donkey, and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots.
   Shrek 2 has also set a new benchmark as the biggest animated debut of all time, topping the $70m taken by the Disney/Pixar animation Finding Nemo.
   It also surpassed the biggest opening film of 2004, Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ which took $89.3m in February.
   在动画片《怪物史莱克２》的成功大大超出人们的预料之后，《怪物史莱克》将再次拍摄两部续集。
  《怪物史莱克２》讲述了一个绿色怪物的探险经历，该片上映的第一个周末就以1.08亿美元创下了美国电影首映票房收入第二的记录。
   梦工厂说，这部电影的成功促使电影公司将第三部和第四部续集的拍摄提上日程。
   公司正在和配音演员们进行洽谈，其中包括卡梅伦・迪亚兹和埃迪・墨菲。
   梦工厂动画片负责人安・戴利说：“在我们不知道第二部是否真正获得成功之前就开始制作第三和第四部是不明智的，当然该片在这个周末的良好表现证明它确实成功了。”
   戴利夫人说，梦工厂也正在和为史莱克和菲奥纳公主配音的麦克・梅尔斯和迪亚兹进行最后的洽谈。
   他们也希望能够与为“会说话的驴”和“穿靴子的猫”配音的墨菲和安东尼奥・班德拉斯达成协议。
   此外，《怪物史莱克２》还创造了动画片首映的票房最高记录，，超过了迪斯尼和皮克斯公司制作的首映票房收入7000万美元的动画片《海底总动员》。
  《怪物史莱克２》也超过了2004年最重要的开幕电影、由梅尔・吉布森执导的《耶稣受难记》。该片在二月份上映，首映票房收入是8930万美元。
