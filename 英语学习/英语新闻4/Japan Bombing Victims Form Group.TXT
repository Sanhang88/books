Japan Bombing Victims Form Group

   Ten victims of the five-year bombing of Chongqing, the provisional capital when Japan invaded China from 1937-1945, recently formed a group to demand compensation from the Japanese government.
   The group is a non-governmental organization composed of 382 bombing victims.
   Intruding Japanese troops bombed the southwestern city on 218 occasions, dropping 21,593 bombs from 9,513 sorties and killing 11,889 people and injuring 14,700 others in five years from February 1938 to August 1943.
   The most intensive bombing occurred on May 3 and 4, 1939, which claimed 3,991 lives and made 200,000 people homeless in the two days, turning into one of the most tragic global massacres.
   Wang Yonggang, 41, one of the organizers, said his group had collected 320 papers recording tragic stories of the victims and a dozen material evidences. The group is demanding a compensation of 31.5 million yuan (US$3.8 million) from the Japanese government.
   Though Wang did not experience the bombardment himself, he read a lot and talked with many victims. In October 2003, he resigned from an ad firm to set up a group to seek compensation from Japan.
   "This isn't something for myself. It concerns tens of millions of people in China. Every Chinese of conscience should stand up," he said.
   Wang's aging father has reproached him for failing to offer a helping hand for the family. But Wang insists on working for the group pro bono. "There must be a person to do this. The demand for compensation is not merely an economic matter, it is an act of safeguarding national dignity, opposing war and calling for peace," he said.
